        "<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/25620/1*nt-ydHhSVsaLXq_HZRaLQA.png\" alt=\"Difference between Transformers and Llama architecture (Llama architecture by Umar Jamil)\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n",

        "\n",
        "Let’s look into the essential concepts of LLaMA with a bit more detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pre-normalization Using RMSNorm:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the LLaMA approach, a technique called RMSNorm is employed for normalizing the input of each transformer sub-layer. This method is inspired by GPT-3 and is designed to optimize the computational cost associated with Layer Normalization. RMSNorm provides similar performance to LayerNorm but reduces the running time significantly (by 7%∼64%).\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3604/1*9FA6P93WhRuWFXxVlPG3LA.png\" alt=\"Root Mean Square Layer Normalization Paper\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It achieves this by emphasizing re-scaling invariance and regulating the summed inputs based on the root mean square (RMS) statistic. The primary motivation is to simplify LayerNorm by removing the mean statistic. Interested readers can explore the detailed implementation of RMSNorm [here](https://github.com/bzhangGo/rmsnorm/blob/master/rmsnorm_torch.py).\n",
        "\n",
        "### SwiGLU Activation Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "LLaMA introduces the SwiGLU activation function, drawing inspiration from PaLM. To understand SwiGLU, it’s essential to first grasp the Swish activation function. SwiGLU extends Swish and involves a custom layer with a dense network to split and multiply input activations.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/13536/1*N3dwnqNUD0TdwPYO0NlhYg.png\" alt=\"SwiGLU: GLU Variants Improve Transformer\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n",
        "\n",
        "The aim is to enhance the expressive power of the model by introducing a more sophisticated activation function. Further details on SwiGLU can be found in the associated [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05202v1.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rotary Embeddings (RoPE):\n",
        "\n",
        "Rotary Embeddings, or RoPE, is a type of position embedding used in LLaMA. It encodes absolute positional information using a rotation matrix and naturally includes explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulations. RoPE offers advantages such as scalability to various sequence lengths and decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is achieved by encoding relative positions through multiplication with a rotation matrix, resulting in decayed relative distances — a desirable feature for natural language encoding. Those interested in the mathematical details can refer to the [RoPE paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864v4.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to these concepts, the LLaMA paper introduces other significant approaches, including the use of the **AdamW optimizer** with specific parameters, efficient implementations such as the causal [multi-head attention operator](https://facebookresearch.github.io/xformers/components/mha.html) available in the xformers library, and manually implemented backward functions for transformer layers to optimize computation during backward passes.\n",
        "\n",

              "\"First Citizen:\\nBefore we proceed any further, hear me speak.\\n\\nAll:\\nSpeak, speak.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nYou are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\\n\\nAll:\\nResolved. resolved.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nFirst, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.\\n\\nAll:\\nWe know't, we know't.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nLet us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.\\nIs't a verdict?\\n\\nAll:\\nNo more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nOne word, good citizens.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWe are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.\\nWhat authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they\\nwould yield us but the superfluity, while it were\\nwholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;\\nbut they think we are too dear: the leanness that\\nafflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an\\ninventory to particularise their abundance; our\\nsufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with\\nour pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I\\nspeak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWould you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?\\n\\nAll:\\nAgainst him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nConsider you what services he has done for his country?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nVery well; and could be content to give him good\\nreport fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nNay, but speak not maliciously.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nI say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did\\nit to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be\\ncontent to say it was for his country he did it to\\nplease his mother and to be partly proud; which he\\nis, even till the altitude of his virtue.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWhat he cannot help in his nature, you account a\\nvice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nIf I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;\\nhe hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.\\nWhat shouts are these? The other side o' the city\\nis risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!\\n\\nAll:\\nCome, come.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nSoft! who comes here?\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWorthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved\\nthe people.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nHe's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you\\nWith bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nOur business is not unknown to the senate; they have\\nhad inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,\\nwhich now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor\\nsuitors have strong breaths: they shall know we\\nhave strong arms too.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,\\nWill you undo yourselves?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWe cannot, sir, we are undone already.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI tell you, friends, most charitable care\\nHave the patricians of you. For your wants,\\nYour suffering in this dearth, you may as well\\nStrike at the heaven with your staves as lift them\\nAgainst the Roman state, whose course will on\\nThe way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs\\nOf more strong link asunder than can ever\\nAppear in your impediment. For the dearth,\\nThe gods, not the patricians, make it, and\\nYour knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,\\nYou are transported by calamity\\nThither where more attends you, and you slander\\nThe helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,\\nWhen you curse them as enemies.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nCare for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us\\nyet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses\\ncrammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to\\nsupport usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act\\nestablished against the rich, and provide more\\npiercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain\\nthe poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and\\nthere's all the love they bear us.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nEither you must\\nConfess yourselves wondrous malicious,\\nOr be accused of folly. I shall tell you\\nA pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;\\nBut, since it serves my purpose, I will venture\\nTo stale 't a little more.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWell, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to\\nfob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please\\nyou, deliver.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThere was a time when all the body's members\\nRebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:\\nThat only like a gulf it did remain\\nI' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,\\nStill cupboarding the viand, never bearing\\nLike labour with the rest, where the other instruments\\nDid see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,\\nAnd, mutually participate, did minister\\nUnto the appetite and affection common\\nOf the whole body. The belly answer'd--\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWell, sir, what answer made the belly?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,\\nWhich ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--\\nFor, look you, I may make the belly smile\\nAs well as speak--it tauntingly replied\\nTo the discontented members, the mutinous parts\\nThat envied his receipt; even so most fitly\\nAs you malign our senators for that\\nThey are not such as you.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nYour belly's answer? What!\\nThe kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,\\nThe counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,\\nOur steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.\\nWith other muniments and petty helps\\nIn this our fabric, if that they--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat then?\\n'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nShould by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,\\nWho is the sink o' the body,--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, what then?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nThe former agents, if they did complain,\\nWhat could the belly answer?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI will tell you\\nIf you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--\\nPatience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nYe're long about it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNote me this, good friend;\\nYour most grave belly was deliberate,\\nNot rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:\\n'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,\\n'That I receive the general food at first,\\nWhich you do live upon; and fit it is,\\nBecause I am the store-house and the shop\\nOf the whole body: but, if you do remember,\\nI send it through the rivers of your blood,\\nEven to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;\\nAnd, through the cranks and offices of man,\\nThe strongest nerves and small inferior veins\\nFrom me receive that natural competency\\nWhereby they live: and though that all at once,\\nYou, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nAy, sir; well, well.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n'Though all at once cannot\\nSee what I do deliver out to each,\\nYet I can make my audit up, that all\\nFrom me do back receive the flour of all,\\nAnd leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nIt was an answer: how apply you this?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe senators of Rome are this good belly,\\nAnd you the mutinous members; for examine\\nTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightly\\nTouching the weal o' the common, you shall find\\nNo public benefit which you receive\\nBut it proceeds or comes from them to you\\nAnd no way from yourselves. What do you think,\\nYou, the great toe of this assembly?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nI the great toe! why the great toe?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,\\nOf this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:\\nThou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,\\nLead'st first to win some vantage.\\nBut make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:\\nRome and her rats are at the point of battle;\\nThe one side must have bale.\\nHail, noble Marcius!\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,\\nThat, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,\\nMake yourselves scabs?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nWe have ever your good word.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHe that will give good words to thee will flatter\\nBeneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,\\nThat like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,\\nThe other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,\\nWhere he should find you lions, finds you hares;\\nWhere foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,\\nThan is the coal of fire upon the ice,\\nOr hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is\\nTo make him worthy whose offence subdues him\\nAnd curse that justice did it.\\nWho deserves greatness\\nDeserves your hate; and your affections are\\nA sick man's appetite, who desires most that\\nWhich would increase his evil. He that depends\\nUpon your favours swims with fins of lead\\nAnd hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?\\nWith every minute you do change a mind,\\nAnd call him noble that was now your hate,\\nHim vile that was your garland. What's the matter,\\nThat in these several places of the city\\nYou cry against the noble senate, who,\\nUnder the gods, keep you in awe, which else\\nWould feed on one another? What's their seeking?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,\\nThe city is well stored.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHang 'em! They say!\\nThey'll sit by the fire, and presume to know\\nWhat's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,\\nWho thrives and who declines; side factions\\nand give out\\nConjectural marriages; making parties strong\\nAnd feebling such as stand not in their liking\\nBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there's\\ngrain enough!\\nWould the nobility lay aside their ruth,\\nAnd let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry\\nWith thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high\\nAs I could pick my lance.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;\\nFor though abundantly they lack discretion,\\nYet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,\\nWhat says the other troop?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThey are dissolved: hang 'em!\\nThey said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,\\nThat hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,\\nThat meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not\\nCorn for the rich men only: with these shreds\\nThey vented their complainings; which being answer'd,\\nAnd a petition granted them, a strange one--\\nTo break the heart of generosity,\\nAnd make bold power look pale--they threw their caps\\nAs they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,\\nShouting their emulation.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat is granted them?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nFive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\\nOf their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,\\nSicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!\\nThe rabble should have first unroof'd the city,\\nEre so prevail'd with me: it will in time\\nWin upon power and throw forth greater themes\\nFor insurrection's arguing.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is strange.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nGo, get you home, you fragments!\\n\\nMessenger:\\nWhere's Caius Marcius?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHere: what's the matter?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThe news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent\\nOur musty superfluity. See, our best elders.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nMarcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;\\nThe Volsces are in arms.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThey have a leader,\\nTullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.\\nI sin in envying his nobility,\\nAnd were I any thing but what I am,\\nI would wish me only he.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou have fought together.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nWere half to half the world by the ears and he.\\nUpon my party, I'ld revolt to make\\nOnly my wars with him: he is a lion\\nThat I am proud to hunt.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThen, worthy Marcius,\\nAttend upon Cominius to these wars.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nIt is your former promise.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSir, it is;\\nAnd I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou\\nShalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.\\nWhat, art thou stiff? stand'st out?\\n\\nTITUS:\\nNo, Caius Marcius;\\nI'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,\\nEre stay behind this business.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO, true-bred!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nYour company to the Capitol; where, I know,\\nOur greatest friends attend us.\\n\\nTITUS:\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nNoble Marcius!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nNay, let them follow:\\nThe Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither\\nTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,\\nYour valour puts well forth: pray, follow.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWas ever man so proud as is this Marcius?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe has no equal.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhen we were chosen tribunes for the people,--\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMark'd you his lip and eyes?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNay. but his taunts.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBeing moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBe-mock the modest moon.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe present wars devour him: he is grown\\nToo proud to be so valiant.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSuch a nature,\\nTickled with good success, disdains the shadow\\nWhich he treads on at noon: but I do wonder\\nHis insolence can brook to be commanded\\nUnder Cominius.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nFame, at the which he aims,\\nIn whom already he's well graced, can not\\nBetter be held nor more attain'd than by\\nA place below the first: for what miscarries\\nShall be the general's fault, though he perform\\nTo the utmost of a man, and giddy censure\\nWill then cry out of Marcius 'O if he\\nHad borne the business!'\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBesides, if things go well,\\nOpinion that so sticks on Marcius shall\\nOf his demerits rob Cominius.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome:\\nHalf all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.\\nThough Marcius earned them not, and all his faults\\nTo Marcius shall be honours, though indeed\\nIn aught he merit not.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLet's hence, and hear\\nHow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,\\nMore than his singularity, he goes\\nUpon this present action.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLets along.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nSo, your opinion is, Aufidius,\\nThat they of Rome are entered in our counsels\\nAnd know how we proceed.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nIs it not yours?\\nWhat ever have been thought on in this state,\\nThat could be brought to bodily act ere Rome\\nHad circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone\\nSince I heard thence; these are the words: I think\\nI have the letter here; yes, here it is.\\n'They have press'd a power, but it is not known\\nWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;\\nThe people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,\\nCominius, Marcius your old enemy,\\nWho is of Rome worse hated than of you,\\nAnd Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,\\nThese three lead on this preparation\\nWhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:\\nConsider of it.'\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nOur army's in the field\\nWe never yet made doubt but Rome was ready\\nTo answer us.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nNor did you think it folly\\nTo keep your great pretences veil'd till when\\nThey needs must show themselves; which\\nin the hatching,\\nIt seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.\\nWe shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was\\nTo take in many towns ere almost Rome\\nShould know we were afoot.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nNoble Aufidius,\\nTake your commission; hie you to your bands:\\nLet us alone to guard Corioli:\\nIf they set down before 's, for the remove\\nBring your army; but, I think, you'll find\\nThey've not prepared for us.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nO, doubt not that;\\nI speak from certainties. Nay, more,\\nSome parcels of their power are forth already,\\nAnd only hitherward. I leave your honours.\\nIf we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,\\n'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike\\nTill one can do no more.\\n\\nAll:\\nThe gods assist you!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAnd keep your honours safe!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nFarewell.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nFarewell.\\n\\nAll:\\nFarewell.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a\\nmore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I\\nshould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he\\nwon honour than in the embracements of his bed where\\nhe would show most love. When yet he was but\\ntender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when\\nyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when\\nfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not\\nsell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering\\nhow honour would become such a person. that it was\\nno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if\\nrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek\\ndanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel\\nwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows\\nbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not\\nmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-child\\nthan now in first seeing he had proved himself a\\nman.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nBut had he died in the business, madam; how then?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThen his good report should have been my son; I\\ntherein would have found issue. Hear me profess\\nsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love\\nalike and none less dear than thine and my good\\nMarcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their\\ncountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.\\n\\nGentlewoman:\\nMadam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nBeseech you, give me leave to retire myself.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nIndeed, you shall not.\\nMethinks I hear hither your husband's drum,\\nSee him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,\\nAs children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:\\nMethinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:\\n'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,\\nThough you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow\\nWith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,\\nLike to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow\\nOr all or lose his hire.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nHis bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAway, you fool! it more becomes a man\\nThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,\\nWhen she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier\\nThan Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood\\nAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,\\nWe are fit to bid her welcome.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nHeavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee\\nAnd tread upon his neck.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nMy ladies both, good day to you.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nSweet madam.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nI am glad to see your ladyship.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nHow do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.\\nWhat are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good\\nfaith. How does your little son?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nI thank your ladyship; well, good madam.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than\\nlook upon his school-master.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nO' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a\\nvery pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'\\nWednesday half an hour together: has such a\\nconfirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded\\nbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go\\nagain; and after it again; and over and over he\\ncomes, and again; catched it again; or whether his\\nfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his\\nteeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked\\nit!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nOne on 's father's moods.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIndeed, la, 'tis a noble child.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nA crack, madam.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nCome, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play\\nthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nNo, good madam; I will not out of doors.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nNot out of doors!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nShe shall, she shall.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nIndeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the\\nthreshold till my lord return from the wars.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nFie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,\\nyou must go visit the good lady that lies in.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nI will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with\\nmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nWhy, I pray you?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\n'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nYou would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all\\nthe yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill\\nIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric\\nwere sensible as your finger, that you might leave\\npricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nNo, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you\\nexcellent news of your husband.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nO, good madam, there can be none yet.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nVerily, I do not jest with you; there came news from\\nhim last night.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nIndeed, madam?\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.\\nThus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against\\nwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of\\nour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set\\ndown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt\\nprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,\\non mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nGive me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every\\nthing hereafter.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nLet her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but\\ndisease our better mirth.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.\\nCome, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy\\nsolemness out o' door. and go along with us.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nNo, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish\\nyou much mirth.\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nWell, then, farewell.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nYonder comes news. A wager they have met.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nMy horse to yours, no.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\n'Tis done.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nAgreed.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSay, has our general met the enemy?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThey lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nSo, the good horse is mine.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI'll buy him of you.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nNo, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will\\nFor half a hundred years. Summon the town.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHow far off lie these armies?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nWithin this mile and half.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThen shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.\\nNow, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,\\nThat we with smoking swords may march from hence,\\nTo help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.\\nTutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNo, nor a man that fears you less than he,\\nThat's lesser than a little.\\nHark! our drums\\nAre bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,\\nRather than they shall pound us up: our gates,\\nWhich yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;\\nThey'll open of themselves.\\nHark you. far off!\\nThere is Aufidius; list, what work he makes\\nAmongst your cloven army.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nO, they are at it!\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nTheir noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThey fear us not, but issue forth their city.\\nNow put your shields before your hearts, and fight\\nWith hearts more proof than shields. Advance,\\nbrave Titus:\\nThey do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,\\nWhich makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:\\nHe that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,\\nAnd he shall feel mine edge.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nAll the contagion of the south light on you,\\nYou shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues\\nPlaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd\\nFurther than seen and one infect another\\nAgainst the wind a mile! You souls of geese,\\nThat bear the shapes of men, how have you run\\nFrom slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!\\nAll hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale\\nWith flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,\\nOr, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe\\nAnd make my wars on you: look to't: come on;\\nIf you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,\\nAs they us to our trenches followed.\\nSo, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:\\n'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,\\nNot for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nFool-hardiness; not I.\\n\\nSecond Soldier:\\nNor I.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nSee, they have shut him in.\\n\\nAll:\\nTo the pot, I warrant him.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nWhat is become of Marcius?\\n\\nAll:\\nSlain, sir, doubtless.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nFollowing the fliers at the very heels,\\nWith them he enters; who, upon the sudden,\\nClapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,\\nTo answer all the city.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nO noble fellow!\\nWho sensibly outdares his senseless sword,\\nAnd, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:\\nA carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,\\nWere not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier\\nEven to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible\\nOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and\\nThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,\\nThou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world\\nWere feverous and did tremble.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nLook, sir.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nO,'tis Marcius!\\nLet's fetch him off, or make remain alike.\\n\\nFirst Roman:\\nThis will I carry to Rome.\\n\\nSecond Roman:\\nAnd I this.\\n\\nThird Roman:\\nA murrain on't! I took this for silver.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSee here these movers that do prize their hours\\nAt a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,\\nIrons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would\\nBury with those that wore them, these base slaves,\\nEre yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!\\nAnd hark, what noise the general makes! To him!\\nThere is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,\\nPiercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take\\nConvenient numbers to make good the city;\\nWhilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste\\nTo help Cominius.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nWorthy sir, thou bleed'st;\\nThy exercise hath been too violent for\\nA second course of fight.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nSir, praise me not;\\nMy work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:\\nThe blood I drop is rather physical\\nThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus\\nI will appear, and fight.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nNow the fair goddess, Fortune,\\nFall deep in love with thee; and her great charms\\nMisguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,\\nProsperity be thy page!\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThy friend no less\\nThan those she placeth highest! So, farewell.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nThou worthiest Marcius!\\nGo, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;\\nCall thither all the officers o' the town,\\nWhere they shall know our mind: away!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nBreathe you, my friends: well fought;\\nwe are come off\\nLike Romans, neither foolish in our stands,\\nNor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,\\nWe shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,\\nBy interims and conveying gusts we have heard\\nThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!\\nLead their successes as we wish our own,\\nThat both our powers, with smiling\\nfronts encountering,\\nMay give you thankful sacrifice.\\nThy news?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThe citizens of Corioli have issued,\\nAnd given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:\\nI saw our party to their trenches driven,\\nAnd then I came away.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThough thou speak'st truth,\\nMethinks thou speak'st not well.\\nHow long is't since?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nAbove an hour, my lord.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\n'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:\\nHow couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,\\nAnd bring thy news so late?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nSpies of the Volsces\\nHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheel\\nThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,\\nHalf an hour since brought my report.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWho's yonder,\\nThat does appear as he were flay'd? O gods\\nHe has the stamp of Marcius; and I have\\nBefore-time seen him thus.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThe shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour\\nMore than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue\\nFrom every meaner man.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nCome I too late?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAy, if you come not in the blood of others,\\nBut mantled in your own.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nO, let me clip ye\\nIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart\\nAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,\\nAnd tapers burn'd to bedward!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nFlower of warriors,\\nHow is it with Titus Lartius?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nAs with a man busied about decrees:\\nCondemning some to death, and some to exile;\\nRansoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;\\nHolding Corioli in the name of Rome,\\nEven like a fawning greyhound in the leash,\\nTo let him slip at will.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWhere is that slave\\nWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?\\nWhere is he? call him hither.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nLet him alone;\\nHe did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,\\nThe common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--\\nThe mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge\\nFrom rascals worse than they.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nBut how prevail'd you?\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nWill the time serve to tell? I do not think.\\nWhere is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?\\nIf not, why cease you till you are so?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nMarcius,\\nWe have at disadvantage fought and did\\nRetire to win our purpose.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nHow lies their battle? know you on which side\\nThey have placed their men of trust?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAs I guess, Marcius,\\nTheir bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,\\nOf their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,\\nTheir very heart of hope.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI do beseech you,\\nBy all the battles wherein we have fought,\\nBy the blood we have shed together, by the vows\\nWe have made to endure friends, that you directly\\nSet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;\\nAnd that you not delay the present, but,\\nFilling the air with swords advanced and darts,\\nWe prove this very hour.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThough I could wish\\nYou were conducted to a gentle bath\\nAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I never\\nDeny your asking: take your choice of those\\nThat best can aid your action.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nThose are they\\nThat most are willing. If any such be here--\\nAs it were sin to doubt--that love this painting\\nWherein you see me smear'd; if any fear\\nLesser his person than an ill report;\\nIf any think brave death outweighs bad life\\nAnd that his country's dearer than himself;\\nLet him alone, or so many so minded,\\nWave thus, to express his disposition,\\nAnd follow Marcius.\\nO, me alone! make you a sword of me?\\nIf these shows be not outward, which of you\\nBut is four Volsces? none of you but is\\nAble to bear against the great Aufidius\\nA shield as hard as his. A certain number,\\nThough thanks to all, must I select\\nfrom all: the rest\\nShall bear the business in some other fight,\\nAs cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;\\nAnd four shall quickly draw out my command,\\nWhich men are best inclined.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nMarch on, my fellows:\\nMake good this ostentation, and you shall\\nDivide in all with us.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nSo, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,\\nAs I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch\\nThose centuries to our aid: the rest will serve\\nFor a short holding: if we lose the field,\\nWe cannot keep the town.\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nFear not our care, sir.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHence, and shut your gates upon's.\\nOur guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee\\nWorse than a promise-breaker.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWe hate alike:\\nNot Afric owns a serpent I abhor\\nMore than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nLet the first budger die the other's slave,\\nAnd the gods doom him after!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nIf I fly, Marcius,\\nHolloa me like a hare.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nWithin these three hours, Tullus,\\nAlone I fought in your Corioli walls,\\nAnd made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood\\nWherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge\\nWrench up thy power to the highest.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWert thou the Hector\\nThat was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,\\nThou shouldst not scape me here.\\nOfficious, and not valiant, you have shamed me\\nIn your condemned seconds.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nIf I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,\\nThou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it\\nWhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,\\nWhere great patricians shall attend and shrug,\\nI' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,\\nAnd, gladly quaked, hear more; where the\\ndull tribunes,\\nThat, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,\\nShall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods\\nOur Rome hath such a soldier.'\\nYet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,\\nHaving fully dined before.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nO general,\\nHere is the steed, we the caparison:\\nHadst thou beheld--\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nPray now, no more: my mother,\\nWho has a charter to extol her blood,\\nWhen she does praise me grieves me. I have done\\nAs you have done; that's what I can; induced\\nAs you have been; that's for my country:\\nHe that has but effected his good will\\nHath overta'en mine act.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou shall not be\\nThe grave of your deserving; Rome must know\\nThe value of her own: 'twere a concealment\\nWorse than a theft, no less than a traducement,\\nTo hide your doings; and to silence that,\\nWhich, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,\\nWould seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you\\nIn sign of what you are, not to reward\\nWhat you have done--before our army hear me.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI have some wounds upon me, and they smart\\nTo hear themselves remember'd.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nShould they not,\\nWell might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,\\nAnd tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,\\nWhereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all\\nThe treasure in this field achieved and city,\\nWe render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,\\nBefore the common distribution, at\\nYour only choice.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nI thank you, general;\\nBut cannot make my heart consent to take\\nA bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;\\nAnd stand upon my common part with those\\nThat have beheld the doing.\\n\\nMARCIUS:\\nMay these same instruments, which you profane,\\nNever sound more! when drums and trumpets shall\\nI' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be\\nMade all of false-faced soothing!\\nWhen steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,\\nLet him be made a coverture for the wars!\\nNo more, I say! For that I have not wash'd\\nMy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--\\nWhich, without note, here's many else have done,--\\nYou shout me forth\\nIn acclamations hyperbolical;\\nAs if I loved my little should be dieted\\nIn praises sauced with lies.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nToo modest are you;\\nMore cruel to your good report than grateful\\nTo us that give you truly: by your patience,\\nIf 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,\\nLike one that means his proper harm, in manacles,\\nThen reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,\\nAs to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius\\nWears this war's garland: in token of the which,\\nMy noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,\\nWith all his trim belonging; and from this time,\\nFor what he did before Corioli, call him,\\nWith all the applause and clamour of the host,\\nCAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear\\nThe addition nobly ever!\\n\\nAll:\\nCaius Marcius Coriolanus!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI will go wash;\\nAnd when my face is fair, you shall perceive\\nWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.\\nI mean to stride your steed, and at all times\\nTo undercrest your good addition\\nTo the fairness of my power.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nSo, to our tent;\\nWhere, ere we do repose us, we will write\\nTo Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,\\nMust to Corioli back: send us to Rome\\nThe best, with whom we may articulate,\\nFor their own good and ours.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nI shall, my lord.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe gods begin to mock me. I, that now\\nRefused most princely gifts, am bound to beg\\nOf my lord general.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nTake't; 'tis yours. What is't?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI sometime lay here in Corioli\\nAt a poor man's house; he used me kindly:\\nHe cried to me; I saw him prisoner;\\nBut then Aufidius was within my view,\\nAnd wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you\\nTo give my poor host freedom.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nO, well begg'd!\\nWere he the butcher of my son, he should\\nBe free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nMarcius, his name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nBy Jupiter! forgot.\\nI am weary; yea, my memory is tired.\\nHave we no wine here?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nGo we to our tent:\\nThe blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time\\nIt should be look'd to: come.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nThe town is ta'en!\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\n'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nCondition!\\nI would I were a Roman; for I cannot,\\nBeing a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!\\nWhat good condition can a treaty find\\nI' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,\\nI have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,\\nAnd wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter\\nAs often as we eat. By the elements,\\nIf e'er again I meet him beard to beard,\\nHe's mine, or I am his: mine emulation\\nHath not that honour in't it had; for where\\nI thought to crush him in an equal force,\\nTrue sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way\\nOr wrath or craft may get him.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nHe's the devil.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nBolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd\\nWith only suffering stain by him; for him\\nShall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,\\nBeing naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,\\nThe prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,\\nEmbarquements all of fury, shall lift up\\nTheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainst\\nMy hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it\\nAt home, upon my brother's guard, even there,\\nAgainst the hospitable canon, would I\\nWash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;\\nLearn how 'tis held; and what they are that must\\nBe hostages for Rome.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nWill not you go?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--\\n'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither\\nHow the world goes, that to the pace of it\\nI may spur on my journey.\\n\\nFirst Soldier:\\nI shall, sir.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGood or bad?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNot according to the prayer of the people, for they\\nlove not Marcius.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNature teaches beasts to know their friends.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray you, who does the wolf love?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe lamb.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAy, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the\\nnoble Marcius.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHe's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two\\nare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.\\n\\nBoth:\\nWell, sir.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIn what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two\\nhave not in abundance?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nEspecially in pride.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAnd topping all others in boasting.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is strange now: do you two know how you are\\ncensured here in the city, I mean of us o' the\\nright-hand file? do you?\\n\\nBoth:\\nWhy, how are we censured?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nBecause you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?\\n\\nBoth:\\nWell, well, sir, well.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of\\noccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:\\ngive your dispositions the reins, and be angry at\\nyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as a\\npleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for\\nbeing proud?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe do it not alone, sir.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI know you can do very little alone; for your helps\\nare many, or else your actions would grow wondrous\\nsingle: your abilities are too infant-like for\\ndoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you\\ncould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,\\nand make but an interior survey of your good selves!\\nO that you could!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhat then, sir?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,\\nproud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as\\nany in Rome.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMenenius, you are known well enough too.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that\\nloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying\\nTiber in't; said to be something imperfect in\\nfavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like\\nupon too trivial motion; one that converses more\\nwith the buttock of the night than with the forehead\\nof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my\\nmalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as\\nyou are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink\\nyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make a\\ncrooked face at it. I can't say your worships have\\ndelivered the matter well, when I find the ass in\\ncompound with the major part of your syllables: and\\nthough I must be content to bear with those that say\\nyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that\\ntell you you have good faces. If you see this in\\nthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known\\nwell enough too? what barm can your bisson\\nconspectuities glean out of this character, if I be\\nknown well enough too?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome, sir, come, we know you well enough.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You\\nare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you\\nwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a\\ncause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;\\nand then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a\\nsecond day of audience. When you are hearing a\\nmatter between party and party, if you chance to be\\npinched with the colic, you make faces like\\nmummers; set up the bloody flag against all\\npatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,\\ndismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled\\nby your hearing: all the peace you make in their\\ncause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are\\na pair of strange ones.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome, come, you are well understood to be a\\nperfecter giber for the table than a necessary\\nbencher in the Capitol.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOur very priests must become mockers, if they shall\\nencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When\\nyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the\\nwagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not\\nso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's\\ncushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-\\nsaddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;\\nwho in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors\\nsince Deucalion, though peradventure some of the\\nbest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to\\nyour worships: more of your conversation would\\ninfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly\\nplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.\\nHow now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,\\nwere she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow\\nyour eyes so fast?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHonourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for\\nthe love of Juno, let's go.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHa! Marcius coming home!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAy, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous\\napprobation.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nTake my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!\\nMarcius coming home!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNay,'tis true.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nLook, here's a letter from him: the state hath\\nanother, his wife another; and, I think, there's one\\nat home for you.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for\\nme!\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nYes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven\\nyears' health; in which time I will make a lip at\\nthe physician: the most sovereign prescription in\\nGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,\\nof no better report than a horse-drench. Is he\\nnot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nO, no, no, no.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSo do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'\\nvictory in his pocket? the wounds become him.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nOn's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home\\nwith the oaken garland.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHas he disciplined Aufidius soundly?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nTitus Lartius writes, they fought together, but\\nAufidius got off.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAnd 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:\\nan he had stayed by him, I would not have been so\\nfidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold\\nthat's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nGood ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate\\nhas letters from the general, wherein he gives my\\nson the whole name of the war: he hath in this\\naction outdone his former deeds doubly\\n\\nVALERIA:\\nIn troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his\\ntrue purchasing.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nThe gods grant them true!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nTrue! pow, wow.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nTrue! I'll be sworn they are true.\\nWhere is he wounded?\\nGod save your good worships! Marcius is coming\\nhome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be\\nlarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shall\\nstand for his place. He received in the repulse of\\nTarquin seven hurts i' the body.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOne i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's\\nnine that I know.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe had, before this last expedition, twenty-five\\nwounds upon him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.\\nHark! the trumpets.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThese are the ushers of Marcius: before him he\\ncarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:\\nDeath, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;\\nWhich, being advanced, declines, and then men die.\\n\\nHerald:\\nKnow, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight\\nWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,\\nWith fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these\\nIn honour follows Coriolanus.\\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\\n\\nAll:\\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo more of this; it does offend my heart:\\nPray now, no more.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nLook, sir, your mother!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO,\\nYou have, I know, petition'd all the gods\\nFor my prosperity!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNay, my good soldier, up;\\nMy gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and\\nBy deed-achieving honour newly named,--\\nWhat is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--\\nBut O, thy wife!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMy gracious silence, hail!\\nWouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,\\nThat weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,\\nSuch eyes the widows in Corioli wear,\\nAnd mothers that lack sons.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow, the gods crown thee!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAnd live you yet?\\nO my sweet lady, pardon.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI know not where to turn: O, welcome home:\\nAnd welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep\\nAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.\\nA curse begin at very root on's heart,\\nThat is not glad to see thee! You are three\\nThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,\\nWe have some old crab-trees here\\nat home that will not\\nBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:\\nWe call a nettle but a nettle and\\nThe faults of fools but folly.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nEver right.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMenenius ever, ever.\\n\\nHerald:\\nGive way there, and go on!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI have lived\\nTo see inherited my very wishes\\nAnd the buildings of my fancy: only\\nThere's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but\\nOur Rome will cast upon thee.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nKnow, good mother,\\nI had rather be their servant in my way,\\nThan sway with them in theirs.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nOn, to the Capitol!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAll tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights\\nAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse\\nInto a rapture lets her baby cry\\nWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins\\nHer richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,\\nClambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,\\nAre smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed\\nWith variable complexions, all agreeing\\nIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens\\nDo press among the popular throngs and puff\\nTo win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames\\nCommit the war of white and damask in\\nTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil\\nOf Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother\\nAs if that whatsoever god who leads him\\nWere slily crept into his human powers\\nAnd gave him graceful posture.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nOn the sudden,\\nI warrant him consul.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThen our office may,\\nDuring his power, go sleep.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe cannot temperately transport his honours\\nFrom where he should begin and end, but will\\nLose those he hath won.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIn that there's comfort.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nDoubt not\\nThe commoners, for whom we stand, but they\\nUpon their ancient malice will forget\\nWith the least cause these his new honours, which\\nThat he will give them make I as little question\\nAs he is proud to do't.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI heard him swear,\\nWere he to stand for consul, never would he\\nAppear i' the market-place nor on him put\\nThe napless vesture of humility;\\nNor showing, as the manner is, his wounds\\nTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Tis right.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIt was his word: O, he would miss it rather\\nThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,\\nAnd the desire of the nobles.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nI wish no better\\nThan have him hold that purpose and to put it\\nIn execution.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\n'Tis most like he will.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nIt shall be to him then as our good wills,\\nA sure destruction.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSo it must fall out\\nTo him or our authorities. For an end,\\nWe must suggest the people in what hatred\\nHe still hath held them; that to's power he would\\nHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders and\\nDispropertied their freedoms, holding them,\\nIn human action and capacity,\\nOf no more soul nor fitness for the world\\nThan camels in the war, who have their provand\\nOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blows\\nFor sinking under them.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis, as you say, suggested\\nAt some time when his soaring insolence\\nShall touch the people--which time shall not want,\\nIf he be put upon 't; and that's as easy\\nAs to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire\\nTo kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze\\nShall darken him for ever.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhat's the matter?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nYou are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought\\nThat Marcius shall be consul:\\nI have seen the dumb men throng to see him and\\nThe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,\\nLadies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,\\nUpon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,\\nAs to Jove's statue, and the commons made\\nA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:\\nI never saw the like.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLet's to the Capitol;\\nAnd carry with us ears and eyes for the time,\\nBut hearts for the event.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave with you.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nCome, come, they are almost here. How many stand\\nfor consulships?\\n\\nSecond Officer:\\nThree, they say: but 'tis thought of every one\\nCoriolanus will carry it.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nThat's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and\\nloves not the common people.\\n\\nSecond Officer:\\nFaith, there had been many great men that have\\nflattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there\\nbe many that they have loved, they know not\\nwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,\\nthey hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for\\nCoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate\\nhim manifests the true knowledge he has in their\\ndisposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets\\nthem plainly see't.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nIf he did not care whether he had their love or no,\\nhe waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither\\ngood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater\\ndevotion than can render it him; and leaves\\nnothing undone that may fully discover him their\\nopposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and\\ndispleasure of the people is as bad as that which he\\ndislikes, to flatter them for their love.\\n\\nSecond Officer:\\nHe hath deserved worthily of his country: and his\\nascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,\\nhaving been supple and courteous to the people,\\nbonneted, without any further deed to have them at\\nan into their estimation and report: but he hath so\\nplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actions\\nin their hearts, that for their tongues to be\\nsilent, and not confess so much, were a kind of\\ningrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a\\nmalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck\\nreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.\\n\\nFirst Officer:\\nNo more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they\\nare coming.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHaving determined of the Volsces and\\nTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,\\nAs the main point of this our after-meeting,\\nTo gratify his noble service that\\nHath thus stood for his country: therefore,\\nplease you,\\nMost reverend and grave elders, to desire\\nThe present consul, and last general\\nIn our well-found successes, to report\\nA little of that worthy work perform'd\\nBy Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom\\nWe met here both to thank and to remember\\nWith honours like himself.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nSpeak, good Cominius:\\nLeave nothing out for length, and make us think\\nRather our state's defective for requital\\nThan we to stretch it out.\\nMasters o' the people,\\nWe do request your kindest ears, and after,\\nYour loving motion toward the common body,\\nTo yield what passes here.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe are convented\\nUpon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts\\nInclinable to honour and advance\\nThe theme of our assembly.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhich the rather\\nWe shall be blest to do, if he remember\\nA kinder value of the people than\\nHe hath hereto prized them at.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThat's off, that's off;\\nI would you rather had been silent. Please you\\nTo hear Cominius speak?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMost willingly;\\nBut yet my caution was more pertinent\\nThan the rebuke you give it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHe loves your people\\nBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.\\nWorthy Cominius, speak.\\nNay, keep your place.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nSit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear\\nWhat you have nobly done.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYour horror's pardon:\\nI had rather have my wounds to heal again\\nThan hear say how I got them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSir, I hope\\nMy words disbench'd you not.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, sir: yet oft,\\nWhen blows have made me stay, I fled from words.\\nYou soothed not, therefore hurt not: but\\nyour people,\\nI love them as they weigh.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray now, sit down.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun\\nWhen the alarum were struck than idly sit\\nTo hear my nothings monster'd.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nMasters of the people,\\nYour multiplying spawn how can he flatter--\\nThat's thousand to one good one--when you now see\\nHe had rather venture all his limbs for honour\\nThan one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus\\nShould not be utter'd feebly. It is held\\nThat valour is the chiefest virtue, and\\nMost dignifies the haver: if it be,\\nThe man I speak of cannot in the world\\nBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,\\nWhen Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought\\nBeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,\\nWhom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,\\nWhen with his Amazonian chin he drove\\nThe bristled lips before him: be bestrid\\nAn o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view\\nSlew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,\\nAnd struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,\\nWhen he might act the woman in the scene,\\nHe proved best man i' the field, and for his meed\\nWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age\\nMan-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,\\nAnd in the brunt of seventeen battles since\\nHe lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,\\nBefore and in Corioli, let me say,\\nI cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;\\nAnd by his rare example made the coward\\nTurn terror into sport: as weeds before\\nA vessel under sail, so men obey'd\\nAnd fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,\\nWhere it did mark, it took; from face to foot\\nHe was a thing of blood, whose every motion\\nWas timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd\\nThe mortal gate of the city, which he painted\\nWith shunless destiny; aidless came off,\\nAnd with a sudden reinforcement struck\\nCorioli like a planet: now all's his:\\nWhen, by and by, the din of war gan pierce\\nHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit\\nRe-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,\\nAnd to the battle came he; where he did\\nRun reeking o'er the lives of men, as if\\n'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd\\nBoth field and city ours, he never stood\\nTo ease his breast with panting.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWorthy man!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nHe cannot but with measure fit the honours\\nWhich we devise him.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nOur spoils he kick'd at,\\nAnd look'd upon things precious as they were\\nThe common muck of the world: he covets less\\nThan misery itself would give; rewards\\nHis deeds with doing them, and is content\\nTo spend the time to end it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHe's right noble:\\nLet him be call'd for.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nCall Coriolanus.\\n\\nOfficer:\\nHe doth appear.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased\\nTo make thee consul.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI do owe them still\\nMy life and services.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIt then remains\\nThat you do speak to the people.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI do beseech you,\\nLet me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot\\nPut on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,\\nFor my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you\\nThat I may pass this doing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSir, the people\\nMust have their voices; neither will they bate\\nOne jot of ceremony.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPut them not to't:\\nPray you, go fit you to the custom and\\nTake to you, as your predecessors have,\\nYour honour with your form.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIt is apart\\nThat I shall blush in acting, and might well\\nBe taken from the people.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMark you that?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTo brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;\\nShow them the unaching scars which I should hide,\\nAs if I had received them for the hire\\nOf their breath only!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDo not stand upon't.\\nWe recommend to you, tribunes of the people,\\nOur purpose to them: and to our noble consul\\nWish we all joy and honour.\\n\\nSenators:\\nTo Coriolanus come all joy and honour!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nYou see how he intends to use the people.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMay they perceive's intent! He will require them,\\nAs if he did contemn what he requested\\nShould be in them to give.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCome, we'll inform them\\nOf our proceedings here: on the marketplace,\\nI know, they do attend us.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nOnce, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWe may, sir, if we will.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nWe have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a\\npower that we have no power to do; for if he show us\\nhis wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our\\ntongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if\\nhe tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him\\nour noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is\\nmonstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,\\nwere to make a monster of the multitude: of the\\nwhich we being members, should bring ourselves to be\\nmonstrous members.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nAnd to make us no better thought of, a little help\\nwill serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he\\nhimself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nWe have been called so of many; not that our heads\\nare some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,\\nbut that our wits are so diversely coloured: and\\ntruly I think if all our wits were to issue out of\\none skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,\\nand their consent of one direct way should be at\\nonce to all the points o' the compass.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nThink you so? Which way do you judge my wit would\\nfly?\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nNay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's\\nwill;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but\\nif it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nWhy that way?\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nTo lose itself in a fog, where being three parts\\nmelted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return\\nfor conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nYou are never without your tricks: you may, you may.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nAre you all resolved to give your voices? But\\nthat's no matter, the greater part carries it. I\\nsay, if he would incline to the people, there was\\nnever a worthier man.\\nHere he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his\\nbehavior. We are not to stay all together, but to\\ncome by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and\\nby threes. He's to make his requests by\\nparticulars; wherein every one of us has a single\\nhonour, in giving him our own voices with our own\\ntongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how\\nyou shall go by him.\\n\\nAll:\\nContent, content.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO sir, you are not right: have you not known\\nThe worthiest men have done't?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat must I say?\\n'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring\\nMy tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!\\nI got them in my country's service, when\\nSome certain of your brethren roar'd and ran\\nFrom the noise of our own drums.'\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO me, the gods!\\nYou must not speak of that: you must desire them\\nTo think upon you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThink upon me! hang 'em!\\nI would they would forget me, like the virtues\\nWhich our divines lose by 'em.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou'll mar all:\\nI'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,\\nIn wholesome manner.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nBid them wash their faces\\nAnd keep their teeth clean.\\nSo, here comes a brace.\\nYou know the cause, air, of my standing here.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nWe do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMine own desert.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nYour own desert!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy, but not mine own desire.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nHow not your own desire?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the\\npoor with begging.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nYou must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to\\ngain by you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nThe price is to ask it kindly.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nKindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to\\nshow you, which shall be yours in private. Your\\ngood voice, sir; what say you?\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nYou shall ha' it, worthy sir.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices\\nbegged. I have your alms: adieu.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nBut this is something odd.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAn 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nPray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your\\nvoices that I may be consul, I have here the\\ncustomary gown.\\n\\nFourth Citizen:\\nYou have deserved nobly of your country, and you\\nhave not deserved nobly.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYour enigma?\\n\\nFourth Citizen:\\nYou have been a scourge to her enemies, you have\\nbeen a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved\\nthe common people.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou should account me the more virtuous that I have\\nnot been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my\\nsworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer\\nestimation of them; 'tis a condition they account\\ngentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is\\nrather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise\\nthe insinuating nod and be off to them most\\ncounterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the\\nbewitchment of some popular man and give it\\nbountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,\\nI may be consul.\\n\\nFifth Citizen:\\nWe hope to find you our friend; and therefore give\\nyou our voices heartily.\\n\\nFourth Citizen:\\nYou have received many wounds for your country.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I\\nwill make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.\\n\\nBoth Citizens:\\nThe gods give you joy, sir, heartily!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMost sweet voices!\\nBetter it is to die, better to starve,\\nThan crave the hire which first we do deserve.\\nWhy in this woolvish toge should I stand here,\\nTo beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,\\nTheir needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:\\nWhat custom wills, in all things should we do't,\\nThe dust on antique time would lie unswept,\\nAnd mountainous error be too highly heapt\\nFor truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,\\nLet the high office and the honour go\\nTo one that would do thus. I am half through;\\nThe one part suffer'd, the other will I do.\\nHere come more voices.\\nYour voices: for your voices I have fought;\\nWatch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear\\nOf wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six\\nI have seen and heard of; for your voices have\\nDone many things, some less, some more your voices:\\nIndeed I would be consul.\\n\\nSixth Citizen:\\nHe has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest\\nman's voice.\\n\\nSeventh Citizen:\\nTherefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,\\nand make him good friend to the people!\\n\\nAll Citizens:\\nAmen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWorthy voices!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have stood your limitation; and the tribunes\\nEndue you with the people's voice: remains\\nThat, in the official marks invested, you\\nAnon do meet the senate.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIs this done?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe custom of request you have discharged:\\nThe people do admit you, and are summon'd\\nTo meet anon, upon your approbation.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhere? at the senate-house?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThere, Coriolanus.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMay I change these garments?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYou may, sir.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThat I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,\\nRepair to the senate-house.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI'll keep you company. Will you along?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe stay here for the people.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFare you well.\\nHe has it now, and by his looks methink\\n'Tis warm at 's heart.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWith a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.\\nwill you dismiss the people?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHow now, my masters! have you chose this man?\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nHe has our voices, sir.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe pray the gods he may deserve your loves.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAmen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,\\nHe mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nCertainly\\nHe flouted us downright.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nNo,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nNot one amongst us, save yourself, but says\\nHe used us scornfully: he should have show'd us\\nHis marks of merit, wounds received for's country.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy, so he did, I am sure.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nNo, no; no man saw 'em.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nHe said he had wounds, which he could show\\nin private;\\nAnd with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,\\n'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,\\nBut by your voices, will not so permit me;\\nYour voices therefore.' When we granted that,\\nHere was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:\\nYour most sweet voices: now you have left\\nyour voices,\\nI have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy either were you ignorant to see't,\\nOr, seeing it, of such childish friendliness\\nTo yield your voices?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCould you not have told him\\nAs you were lesson'd, when he had no power,\\nBut was a petty servant to the state,\\nHe was your enemy, ever spake against\\nYour liberties and the charters that you bear\\nI' the body of the weal; and now, arriving\\nA place of potency and sway o' the state,\\nIf he should still malignantly remain\\nFast foe to the plebeii, your voices might\\nBe curses to yourselves? You should have said\\nThat as his worthy deeds did claim no less\\nThan what he stood for, so his gracious nature\\nWould think upon you for your voices and\\nTranslate his malice towards you into love,\\nStanding your friendly lord.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThus to have said,\\nAs you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit\\nAnd tried his inclination; from him pluck'd\\nEither his gracious promise, which you might,\\nAs cause had call'd you up, have held him to\\nOr else it would have gall'd his surly nature,\\nWhich easily endures not article\\nTying him to aught; so putting him to rage,\\nYou should have ta'en the advantage of his choler\\nAnd pass'd him unelected.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nDid you perceive\\nHe did solicit you in free contempt\\nWhen he did need your loves, and do you think\\nThat his contempt shall not be bruising to you,\\nWhen he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies\\nNo heart among you? or had you tongues to cry\\nAgainst the rectorship of judgment?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave you\\nEre now denied the asker? and now again\\nOf him that did not ask, but mock, bestow\\nYour sued-for tongues?\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nHe's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAnd will deny him:\\nI'll have five hundred voices of that sound.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nI twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGet you hence instantly, and tell those friends,\\nThey have chose a consul that will from them take\\nTheir liberties; make them of no more voice\\nThan dogs that are as often beat for barking\\nAs therefore kept to do so.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLet them assemble,\\nAnd on a safer judgment all revoke\\nYour ignorant election; enforce his pride,\\nAnd his old hate unto you; besides, forget not\\nWith what contempt he wore the humble weed,\\nHow in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,\\nThinking upon his services, took from you\\nThe apprehension of his present portance,\\nWhich most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion\\nAfter the inveterate hate he bears you.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLay\\nA fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,\\nNo impediment between, but that you must\\nCast your election on him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSay, you chose him\\nMore after our commandment than as guided\\nBy your own true affections, and that your minds,\\nPreoccupied with what you rather must do\\nThan what you should, made you against the grain\\nTo voice him consul: lay the fault on us.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAy, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.\\nHow youngly he began to serve his country,\\nHow long continued, and what stock he springs of,\\nThe noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came\\nThat Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,\\nWho, after great Hostilius, here was king;\\nOf the same house Publius and Quintus were,\\nThat our beat water brought by conduits hither;\\nAnd  \\nTwice being  \\nWas his great ancestor.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nOne thus descended,\\nThat hath beside well in his person wrought\\nTo be set high in place, we did commend\\nTo your remembrances: but you have found,\\nScaling his present bearing with his past,\\nThat he's your fixed enemy, and revoke\\nYour sudden approbation.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSay, you ne'er had done't--\\nHarp on that still--but by our putting on;\\nAnd presently, when you have drawn your number,\\nRepair to the Capitol.\\n\\nAll:\\nWe will so: almost all\\nRepent in their election.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLet them go on;\\nThis mutiny were better put in hazard,\\nThan stay, past doubt, for greater:\\nIf, as his nature is, he fall in rage\\nWith their refusal, both observe and answer\\nThe vantage of his anger.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nTo the Capitol, come:\\nWe will be there before the stream o' the people;\\nAnd this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,\\nWhich we have goaded onward.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTullus Aufidius then had made new head?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHe had, my lord; and that it was which caused\\nOur swifter composition.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSo then the Volsces stand but as at first,\\nReady, when time shall prompt them, to make road.\\nUpon's again.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThey are worn, lord consul, so,\\nThat we shall hardly in our ages see\\nTheir banners wave again.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSaw you Aufidius?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nOn safe-guard he came to me; and did curse\\nAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilely\\nYielded the town: he is retired to Antium.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSpoke he of me?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHe did, my lord.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHow? what?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nHow often he had met you, sword to sword;\\nThat of all things upon the earth he hated\\nYour person most, that he would pawn his fortunes\\nTo hopeless restitution, so he might\\nBe call'd your vanquisher.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAt Antium lives he?\\n\\nLARTIUS:\\nAt Antium.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI wish I had a cause to seek him there,\\nTo oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.\\nBehold, these are the tribunes of the people,\\nThe tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;\\nFor they do prank them in authority,\\nAgainst all noble sufferance.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPass no further.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHa! what is that?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIt will be dangerous to go on: no further.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat makes this change?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe matter?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHath he not pass'd the noble and the common?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCominius, no.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHave I had children's voices?\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nTribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe people are incensed against him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nStop,\\nOr all will fall in broil.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAre these your herd?\\nMust these have voices, that can yield them now\\nAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What are\\nyour offices?\\nYou being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?\\nHave you not set them on?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nBe calm, be calm.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIt is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,\\nTo curb the will of the nobility:\\nSuffer't, and live with such as cannot rule\\nNor ever will be ruled.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCall't not a plot:\\nThe people cry you mock'd them, and of late,\\nWhen corn was given them gratis, you repined;\\nScandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them\\nTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhy, this was known before.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNot to them all.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHave you inform'd them sithence?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHow! I inform them!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou are like to do such business.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNot unlike,\\nEach way, to better yours.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhy then should I be consul? By yond clouds,\\nLet me deserve so ill as you, and make me\\nYour fellow tribune.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYou show too much of that\\nFor which the people stir: if you will pass\\nTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,\\nWhich you are out of, with a gentler spirit,\\nOr never be so noble as a consul,\\nNor yoke with him for tribune.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nLet's be calm.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThe people are abused; set on. This paltering\\nBecomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus\\nDeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely\\nI' the plain way of his merit.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTell me of corn!\\nThis was my speech, and I will speak't again--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNot now, not now.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNot in this heat, sir, now.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNow, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,\\nI crave their pardons:\\nFor the mutable, rank-scented many, let them\\nRegard me as I do not flatter, and\\nTherein behold themselves: I say again,\\nIn soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate\\nThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,\\nWhich we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,\\nand scatter'd,\\nBy mingling them with us, the honour'd number,\\nWho lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that\\nWhich they have given to beggars.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, no more.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNo more words, we beseech you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHow! no more!\\nAs for my country I have shed my blood,\\nNot fearing outward force, so shall my lungs\\nCoin words till their decay against those measles,\\nWhich we disdain should tatter us, yet sought\\nThe very way to catch them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nYou speak o' the people,\\nAs if you were a god to punish, not\\nA man of their infirmity.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Twere well\\nWe let the people know't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat, what? his choler?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nCholer!\\nWere I as patient as the midnight sleep,\\nBy Jove, 'twould be my mind!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nIt is a mind\\nThat shall remain a poison where it is,\\nNot poison any further.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nShall remain!\\nHear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you\\nHis absolute 'shall'?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\n'Twas from the canon.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\n'Shall'!\\nO good but most unwise patricians! why,\\nYou grave but reckless senators, have you thus\\nGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,\\nThat with his peremptory 'shall,' being but\\nThe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit\\nTo say he'll turn your current in a ditch,\\nAnd make your channel his? If he have power\\nThen vail your ignorance; if none, awake\\nYour dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,\\nBe not as common fools; if you are not,\\nLet them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,\\nIf they be senators: and they are no less,\\nWhen, both your voices blended, the great'st taste\\nMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,\\nAnd such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'\\nHis popular 'shall' against a graver bench\\nThan ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!\\nIt makes the consuls base: and my soul aches\\nTo know, when two authorities are up,\\nNeither supreme, how soon confusion\\nMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and take\\nThe one by the other.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWell, on to the market-place.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhoever gave that counsel, to give forth\\nThe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used\\nSometime in Greece,--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, well, no more of that.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThough there the people had more absolute power,\\nI say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed\\nThe ruin of the state.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhy, shall the people give\\nOne that speaks thus their voice?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI'll give my reasons,\\nMore worthier than their voices. They know the corn\\nWas not our recompense, resting well assured\\nThat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,\\nEven when the navel of the state was touch'd,\\nThey would not thread the gates. This kind of service\\nDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war\\nTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd\\nMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusation\\nWhich they have often made against the senate,\\nAll cause unborn, could never be the motive\\nOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?\\nHow shall this bisson multitude digest\\nThe senate's courtesy? Let deeds express\\nWhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;\\nWe are the greater poll, and in true fear\\nThey gave us our demands.' Thus we debase\\nThe nature of our seats and make the rabble\\nCall our cares fears; which will in time\\nBreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring in\\nThe crows to peck the eagles.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCome, enough.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nEnough, with over-measure.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, take more:\\nWhat may be sworn by, both divine and human,\\nSeal what I end withal! This double worship,\\nWhere one part does disdain with cause, the other\\nInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,\\nCannot conclude but by the yea and no\\nOf general ignorance,--it must omit\\nReal necessities, and give way the while\\nTo unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,\\nit follows,\\nNothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--\\nYou that will be less fearful than discreet,\\nThat love the fundamental part of state\\nMore than you doubt the change on't, that prefer\\nA noble life before a long, and wish\\nTo jump a body with a dangerous physic\\nThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck out\\nThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\\nThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonour\\nMangles true judgment and bereaves the state\\nOf that integrity which should become't,\\nNot having the power to do the good it would,\\nFor the in which doth control't.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHas said enough.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHas spoken like a traitor, and shall answer\\nAs traitors do.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!\\nWhat should the people do with these bald tribunes?\\nOn whom depending, their obedience fails\\nTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,\\nWhen what's not meet, but what must be, was law,\\nThen were they chosen: in a better hour,\\nLet what is meet be said it must be meet,\\nAnd throw their power i' the dust.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nManifest treason!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis a consul? no.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe aediles, ho!\\nLet him be apprehended.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGo, call the people:\\nin whose name myself\\nAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,\\nA foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,\\nAnd follow to thine answer.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHence, old goat!\\n\\nSenators, &C:\\nWe'll surety him.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAged sir, hands off.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones\\nOut of thy garments.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHelp, ye citizens!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOn both sides more respect.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHere's he that would take from you all your power.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSeize him, AEdiles!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nDown with him! down with him!\\n\\nSenators, &C:\\nWeapons, weapons, weapons!\\n'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'\\n'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'\\n'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat is about to be? I am out of breath;\\nConfusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes\\nTo the people! Coriolanus, patience!\\nSpeak, good Sicinius.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHear me, people; peace!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nLet's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYou are at point to lose your liberties:\\nMarcius would have all from you; Marcius,\\nWhom late you have named for consul.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFie, fie, fie!\\nThis is the way to kindle, not to quench.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nTo unbuild the city and to lay all flat.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat is the city but the people?\\n\\nCitizens:\\nTrue,\\nThe people are the city.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBy the consent of all, we were establish'd\\nThe people's magistrates.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nYou so remain.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAnd so are like to do.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nThat is the way to lay the city flat;\\nTo bring the roof to the foundation,\\nAnd bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,\\nIn heaps and piles of ruin.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis deserves death.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nOr let us stand to our authority,\\nOr let us lose it. We do here pronounce,\\nUpon the part o' the people, in whose power\\nWe were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy\\nOf present death.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nTherefore lay hold of him;\\nBear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence\\nInto destruction cast him.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAEdiles, seize him!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nYield, Marcius, yield!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHear me one word;\\nBeseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nPeace, peace!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nSir, those cold ways,\\nThat seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous\\nWhere the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,\\nAnd bear him to the rock.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, I'll die here.\\nThere's some among you have beheld me fighting:\\nCome, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDown with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLay hands upon him.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHelp Marcius, help,\\nYou that be noble; help him, young and old!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nDown with him, down with him!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nGo, get you to your house; be gone, away!\\nAll will be naught else.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nGet you gone.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nStand fast;\\nWe have as many friends as enemies.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSham it be put to that?\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThe gods forbid!\\nI prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;\\nLeave us to cure this cause.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor 'tis a sore upon us,\\nYou cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nCome, sir, along with us.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI would they were barbarians--as they are,\\nThough in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,\\nThough calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nBe gone;\\nPut not your worthy rage into your tongue;\\nOne time will owe another.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nOn fair ground\\nI could beat forty of them.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI could myself\\nTake up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the\\ntwo tribunes:\\nBut now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;\\nAnd manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands\\nAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,\\nBefore the tag return? whose rage doth rend\\nLike interrupted waters and o'erbear\\nWhat they are used to bear.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray you, be gone:\\nI'll try whether my old wit be in request\\nWith those that have but little: this must be patch'd\\nWith cloth of any colour.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nNay, come away.\\n\\nA Patrician:\\nThis man has marr'd his fortune.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHis nature is too noble for the world:\\nHe would not flatter Neptune for his trident,\\nOr Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:\\nWhat his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;\\nAnd, being angry, does forget that ever\\nHe heard the name of death.\\nHere's goodly work!\\n\\nSecond Patrician:\\nI would they were abed!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!\\nCould he not speak 'em fair?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhere is this viper\\nThat would depopulate the city and\\nBe every man himself?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou worthy tribunes,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock\\nWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,\\nAnd therefore law shall scorn him further trial\\nThan the severity of the public power\\nWhich he so sets at nought.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nHe shall well know\\nThe noble tribunes are the people's mouths,\\nAnd we their hands.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nHe shall, sure on't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSir, sir,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPeace!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDo not cry havoc, where you should but hunt\\nWith modest warrant.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSir, how comes't that you\\nHave holp to make this rescue?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHear me speak:\\nAs I do know the consul's worthiness,\\nSo can I name his faults,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nConsul! what consul?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe consul Coriolanus.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHe consul!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nNo, no, no, no, no.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIf, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,\\nI may be heard, I would crave a word or two;\\nThe which shall turn you to no further harm\\nThan so much loss of time.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nSpeak briefly then;\\nFor we are peremptory to dispatch\\nThis viperous traitor: to eject him hence\\nWere but one danger, and to keep him here\\nOur certain death: therefore it is decreed\\nHe dies to-night.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow the good gods forbid\\nThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitude\\nTowards her deserved children is enroll'd\\nIn Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam\\nShould now eat up her own!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe's a disease that must be cut away.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nO, he's a limb that has but a disease;\\nMortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.\\nWhat has he done to Rome that's worthy death?\\nKilling our enemies, the blood he hath lost--\\nWhich, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,\\nBy many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;\\nAnd what is left, to lose it by his country,\\nWere to us all, that do't and suffer it,\\nA brand to the end o' the world.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis is clean kam.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nMerely awry: when he did love his country,\\nIt honour'd him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThe service of the foot\\nBeing once gangrened, is not then respected\\nFor what before it was.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe'll hear no more.\\nPursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:\\nLest his infection, being of catching nature,\\nSpread further.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOne word more, one word.\\nThis tiger-footed rage, when it shall find\\nThe harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late\\nTie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;\\nLest parties, as he is beloved, break out,\\nAnd sack great Rome with Romans.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIf it were so,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat do ye talk?\\nHave we not had a taste of his obedience?\\nOur aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nConsider this: he has been bred i' the wars\\nSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd\\nIn bolted language; meal and bran together\\nHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,\\nI'll go to him, and undertake to bring him\\nWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,\\nIn peace, to his utmost peril.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNoble tribunes,\\nIt is the humane way: the other course\\nWill prove too bloody, and the end of it\\nUnknown to the beginning.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNoble Menenius,\\nBe you then as the people's officer.\\nMasters, lay down your weapons.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGo not home.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMeet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:\\nWhere, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed\\nIn our first way.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI'll bring him to you.\\nLet me desire your company: he must come,\\nOr what is worst will follow.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nPray you, let's to him.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet them puff all about mine ears, present me\\nDeath on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,\\nOr pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,\\nThat the precipitation might down stretch\\nBelow the beam of sight, yet will I still\\nBe thus to them.\\n\\nA Patrician:\\nYou do the nobler.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI muse my mother\\nDoes not approve me further, who was wont\\nTo call them woollen vassals, things created\\nTo buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads\\nIn congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,\\nWhen one but of my ordinance stood up\\nTo speak of peace or war.\\nI talk of you:\\nWhy did you wish me milder? would you have me\\nFalse to my nature? Rather say I play\\nThe man I am.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, sir, sir, sir,\\nI would have had you put your power well on,\\nBefore you had worn it out.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet go.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nYou might have been enough the man you are,\\nWith striving less to be so; lesser had been\\nThe thwartings of your dispositions, if\\nYou had not show'd them how ye were disposed\\nEre they lack'd power to cross you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet them hang.\\n\\nA Patrician:\\nAy, and burn too.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCome, come, you have been too rough, something\\ntoo rough;\\nYou must return and mend it.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThere's no remedy;\\nUnless, by not so doing, our good city\\nCleave in the midst, and perish.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nPray, be counsell'd:\\nI have a heart as little apt as yours,\\nBut yet a brain that leads my use of anger\\nTo better vantage.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell said, noble woman?\\nBefore he should thus stoop to the herd, but that\\nThe violent fit o' the time craves it as physic\\nFor the whole state, I would put mine armour on,\\nWhich I can scarcely bear.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat must I do?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nReturn to the tribunes.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell, what then? what then?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nRepent what you have spoke.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFor them! I cannot do it to the gods;\\nMust I then do't to them?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nYou are too absolute;\\nThough therein you can never be too noble,\\nBut when extremities speak. I have heard you say,\\nHonour and policy, like unsever'd friends,\\nI' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,\\nIn peace what each of them by the other lose,\\nThat they combine not there.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTush, tush!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA good demand.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nIf it be honour in your wars to seem\\nThe same you are not, which, for your best ends,\\nYou adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,\\nThat it shall hold companionship in peace\\nWith honour, as in war, since that to both\\nIt stands in like request?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhy force you this?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nBecause that now it lies you on to speak\\nTo the people; not by your own instruction,\\nNor by the matter which your heart prompts you,\\nBut with such words that are but rooted in\\nYour tongue, though but bastards and syllables\\nOf no allowance to your bosom's truth.\\nNow, this no more dishonours you at all\\nThan to take in a town with gentle words,\\nWhich else would put you to your fortune and\\nThe hazard of much blood.\\nI would dissemble with my nature where\\nMy fortunes and my friends at stake required\\nI should do so in honour: I am in this,\\nYour wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;\\nAnd you will rather show our general louts\\nHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,\\nFor the inheritance of their loves and safeguard\\nOf what that want might ruin.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNoble lady!\\nCome, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,\\nNot what is dangerous present, but the loss\\nOf what is past.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI prithee now, my son,\\nGo to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;\\nAnd thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--\\nThy knee bussing the stones--for in such business\\nAction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant\\nMore learned than the ears--waving thy head,\\nWhich often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,\\nNow humble as the ripest mulberry\\nThat will not hold the handling: or say to them,\\nThou art their soldier, and being bred in broils\\nHast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,\\nWere fit for thee to use as they to claim,\\nIn asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame\\nThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far\\nAs thou hast power and person.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis but done,\\nEven as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;\\nFor they have pardons, being ask'd, as free\\nAs words to little purpose.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nPrithee now,\\nGo, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather\\nFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulf\\nThan flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit\\nYou make strong party, or defend yourself\\nBy calmness or by absence: all's in anger.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nOnly fair speech.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI think 'twill serve, if he\\nCan thereto frame his spirit.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nHe must, and will\\nPrithee now, say you will, and go about it.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMust I go show them my unbarbed sconce?\\nMust I with base tongue give my noble heart\\nA lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:\\nYet, were there but this single plot to lose,\\nThis mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it\\nAnd throw't against the wind. To the market-place!\\nYou have put me now to such a part which never\\nI shall discharge to the life.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nCome, come, we'll prompt you.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nI prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said\\nMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,\\nTo have my praise for this, perform a part\\nThou hast not done before.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell, I must do't:\\nAway, my disposition, and possess me\\nSome harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,\\nWhich quired with my drum, into a pipe\\nSmall as an eunuch, or the virgin voice\\nThat babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves\\nTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up\\nThe glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue\\nMake motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,\\nWho bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his\\nThat hath received an alms! I will not do't,\\nLest I surcease to honour mine own truth\\nAnd by my body's action teach my mind\\nA most inherent baseness.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAt thy choice, then:\\nTo beg of thee, it is my more dishonour\\nThan thou of them. Come all to ruin; let\\nThy mother rather feel thy pride than fear\\nThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death\\nWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou list\\nThy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,\\nBut owe thy pride thyself.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nPray, be content:\\nMother, I am going to the market-place;\\nChide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,\\nCog their hearts from them, and come home beloved\\nOf all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:\\nCommend me to my wife. I'll return consul;\\nOr never trust to what my tongue can do\\nI' the way of flattery further.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nDo your will.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAway! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself\\nTo answer mildly; for they are prepared\\nWith accusations, as I hear, more strong\\nThan are upon you yet.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:\\nLet them accuse me by invention, I\\nWill answer in mine honour.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAy, but mildly.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWell, mildly be it then. Mildly!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nIn this point charge him home, that he affects\\nTyrannical power: if he evade us there,\\nEnforce him with his envy to the people,\\nAnd that the spoil got on the Antiates\\nWas ne'er distributed.\\nWhat, will he come?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nHe's coming.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nHow accompanied?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nWith old Menenius, and those senators\\nThat always favour'd him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave you a catalogue\\nOf all the voices that we have procured\\nSet down by the poll?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nI have; 'tis ready.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHave you collected them by tribes?\\n\\nAEdile:\\nI have.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAssemble presently the people hither;\\nAnd when they bear me say 'It shall be so\\nI' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either\\nFor death, for fine, or banishment, then let them\\nIf I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'\\nInsisting on the old prerogative\\nAnd power i' the truth o' the cause.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nI shall inform them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nAnd when such time they have begun to cry,\\nLet them not cease, but with a din confused\\nEnforce the present execution\\nOf what we chance to sentence.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nVery well.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMake them be strong and ready for this hint,\\nWhen we shall hap to give 't them.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGo about it.\\nPut him to choler straight: he hath been used\\nEver to conquer, and to have his worth\\nOf contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot\\nBe rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks\\nWhat's in his heart; and that is there which looks\\nWith us to break his neck.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWell, here he comes.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCalmly, I do beseech you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece\\nWill bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods\\nKeep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice\\nSupplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!\\nThrong our large temples with the shows of peace,\\nAnd not our streets with war!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nAmen, amen.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nA noble wish.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nDraw near, ye people.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nList to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFirst, hear me speak.\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nWell, say. Peace, ho!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nShall I be charged no further than this present?\\nMust all determine here?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nI do demand,\\nIf you submit you to the people's voices,\\nAllow their officers and are content\\nTo suffer lawful censure for such faults\\nAs shall be proved upon you?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI am content.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nLo, citizens, he says he is content:\\nThe warlike service he has done, consider; think\\nUpon the wounds his body bears, which show\\nLike graves i' the holy churchyard.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nScratches with briers,\\nScars to move laughter only.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nConsider further,\\nThat when he speaks not like a citizen,\\nYou find him like a soldier: do not take\\nHis rougher accents for malicious sounds,\\nBut, as I say, such as become a soldier,\\nRather than envy you.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWell, well, no more.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat is the matter\\nThat being pass'd for consul with full voice,\\nI am so dishonour'd that the very hour\\nYou take it off again?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAnswer to us.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nSay, then: 'tis true, I ought so.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe charge you, that you have contrived to take\\nFrom Rome all season'd office and to wind\\nYourself into a power tyrannical;\\nFor which you are a traitor to the people.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHow! traitor!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, temperately; your promise.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!\\nCall me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!\\nWithin thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,\\nIn thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in\\nThy lying tongue both numbers, I would say\\n'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free\\nAs I do pray the gods.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nMark you this, people?\\n\\nCitizens:\\nTo the rock, to the rock with him!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPeace!\\nWe need not put new matter to his charge:\\nWhat you have seen him do and heard him speak,\\nBeating your officers, cursing yourselves,\\nOpposing laws with strokes and here defying\\nThose whose great power must try him; even this,\\nSo criminal and in such capital kind,\\nDeserves the extremest death.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBut since he hath\\nServed well for Rome,--\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat do you prate of service?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI talk of that, that know it.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIs this the promise that you made your mother?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nKnow, I pray you,--\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI know no further:\\nLet them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,\\nVagabond exile, raying, pent to linger\\nBut with a grain a day, I would not buy\\nTheir mercy at the price of one fair word;\\nNor cheque my courage for what they can give,\\nTo have't with saying 'Good morrow.'\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFor that he has,\\nAs much as in him lies, from time to time\\nEnvied against the people, seeking means\\nTo pluck away their power, as now at last\\nGiven hostile strokes, and that not in the presence\\nOf dreaded justice, but on the ministers\\nThat do distribute it; in the name o' the people\\nAnd in the power of us the tribunes, we,\\nEven from this instant, banish him our city,\\nIn peril of precipitation\\nFrom off the rock Tarpeian never more\\nTo enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,\\nI say it shall be so.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nIt shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:\\nHe's banish'd, and it shall be so.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHear me, my masters, and my common friends,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe's sentenced; no more hearing.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nLet me speak:\\nI have been consul, and can show for Rome\\nHer enemies' marks upon me. I do love\\nMy country's good with a respect more tender,\\nMore holy and profound, than mine own life,\\nMy dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,\\nAnd treasure of my loins; then if I would\\nSpeak that,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe know your drift: speak what?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThere's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,\\nAs enemy to the people and his country:\\nIt shall be so.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nIt shall be so, it shall be so.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou common cry of curs! whose breath I hate\\nAs reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize\\nAs the dead carcasses of unburied men\\nThat do corrupt my air, I banish you;\\nAnd here remain with your uncertainty!\\nLet every feeble rumour shake your hearts!\\nYour enemies, with nodding of their plumes,\\nFan you into despair! Have the power still\\nTo banish your defenders; till at length\\nYour ignorance, which finds not till it feels,\\nMaking not reservation of yourselves,\\nStill your own foes, deliver you as most\\nAbated captives to some nation\\nThat won you without blows! Despising,\\nFor you, the city, thus I turn my back:\\nThere is a world elsewhere.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nThe people's enemy is gone, is gone!\\n\\nCitizens:\\nOur enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGo, see him out at gates, and follow him,\\nAs he hath followed you, with all despite;\\nGive him deserved vexation. Let a guard\\nAttend us through the city.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nCome, come; let's see him out at gates; come.\\nThe gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nCome, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast\\nWith many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,\\nWhere is your ancient courage? you were used\\nTo say extremity was the trier of spirits;\\nThat common chances common men could bear;\\nThat when the sea was calm all boats alike\\nShow'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,\\nWhen most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves\\nA noble cunning: you were used to load me\\nWith precepts that would make invincible\\nThe heart that conn'd them.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nO heavens! O heavens!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNay! prithee, woman,--\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNow the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,\\nAnd occupations perish!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat, what, what!\\nI shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.\\nResume that spirit, when you were wont to say,\\nIf you had been the wife of Hercules,\\nSix of his labours you'ld have done, and saved\\nYour husband so much sweat. Cominius,\\nDroop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:\\nI'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,\\nThy tears are salter than a younger man's,\\nAnd venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,\\nI have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld\\nHeart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women\\n'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,\\nAs 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well\\nMy hazards still have been your solace: and\\nBelieve't not lightly--though I go alone,\\nLike to a lonely dragon, that his fen\\nMakes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son\\nWill or exceed the common or be caught\\nWith cautelous baits and practise.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nMy first son.\\nWhither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius\\nWith thee awhile: determine on some course,\\nMore than a wild exposture to each chance\\nThat starts i' the way before thee.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO the gods!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI'll follow thee a month, devise with thee\\nWhere thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us\\nAnd we of thee: so if the time thrust forth\\nA cause for thy repeal, we shall not send\\nO'er the vast world to seek a single man,\\nAnd lose advantage, which doth ever cool\\nI' the absence of the needer.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFare ye well:\\nThou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full\\nOf the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one\\nThat's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.\\nCome, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and\\nMy friends of noble touch, when I am forth,\\nBid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.\\nWhile I remain above the ground, you shall\\nHear from me still, and never of me aught\\nBut what is like me formerly.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThat's worthily\\nAs any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.\\nIf I could shake off but one seven years\\nFrom these old arms and legs, by the good gods,\\nI'ld with thee every foot.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nGive me thy hand: Come.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.\\nThe nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided\\nIn his behalf.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNow we have shown our power,\\nLet us seem humbler after it is done\\nThan when it was a-doing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nBid them home:\\nSay their great enemy is gone, and they\\nStand in their ancient strength.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nDismiss them home.\\nHere comes his mother.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLet's not meet her.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWhy?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThey say she's mad.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThey have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods\\nRequite your love!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPeace, peace; be not so loud.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nIf that I could for weeping, you should hear,--\\nNay, and you shall hear some.\\nWill you be gone?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAre you mankind?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAy, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.\\nWas not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship\\nTo banish him that struck more blows for Rome\\nThan thou hast spoken words?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nO blessed heavens!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nMore noble blows than ever thou wise words;\\nAnd for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:\\nNay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son\\nWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,\\nHis good sword in his hand.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat then?\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nWhat then!\\nHe'ld make an end of thy posterity.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nBastards and all.\\nGood man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCome, come, peace.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nI would he had continued to his country\\nAs he began, and not unknit himself\\nThe noble knot he made.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI would he had.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\n'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:\\nCats, that can judge as fitly of his worth\\nAs I can of those mysteries which heaven\\nWill not have earth to know.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nPray, let us go.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNow, pray, sir, get you gone:\\nYou have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--\\nAs far as doth the Capitol exceed\\nThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son--\\nThis lady's husband here, this, do you see--\\nWhom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWell, well, we'll leave you.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy stay we to be baited\\nWith one that wants her wits?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nTake my prayers with you.\\nI would the gods had nothing else to do\\nBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em\\nBut once a-day, it would unclog my heart\\nOf what lies heavy to't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have told them home;\\nAnd, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nAnger's my meat; I sup upon myself,\\nAnd so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:\\nLeave this faint puling and lament as I do,\\nIn anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFie, fie, fie!\\n\\nRoman:\\nI know you well, sir, and you know\\nme: your name, I think, is Adrian.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nIt is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.\\n\\nRoman:\\nI am a Roman; and my services are,\\nas you are, against 'em: know you me yet?\\n\\nVolsce:\\nNicanor? no.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThe same, sir.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nYou had more beard when I last saw you; but your\\nfavour is well approved by your tongue. What's the\\nnews in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,\\nto find you out there: you have well saved me a\\nday's journey.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThere hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the\\npeople against the senators, patricians, and nobles.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nHath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not\\nso: they are in a most warlike preparation, and\\nhope to come upon them in the heat of their division.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThe main blaze of it is past, but a small thing\\nwould make it flame again: for the nobles receive\\nso to heart the banishment of that worthy\\nCoriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take\\nall power from the people and to pluck from them\\ntheir tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can\\ntell you, and is almost mature for the violent\\nbreaking out.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nCoriolanus banished!\\n\\nRoman:\\nBanished, sir.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nYou will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.\\n\\nRoman:\\nThe day serves well for them now. I have heard it\\nsaid, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is\\nwhen she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble\\nTullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his\\ngreat opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request\\nof his country.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nHe cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus\\naccidentally to encounter you: you have ended my\\nbusiness, and I will merrily accompany you home.\\n\\nRoman:\\nI shall, between this and supper, tell you most\\nstrange things from Rome; all tending to the good of\\ntheir adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?\\n\\nVolsce:\\nA most royal one; the centurions and their charges,\\ndistinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,\\nand to be on foot at an hour's warning.\\n\\nRoman:\\nI am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the\\nman, I think, that shall set them in present action.\\nSo, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.\\n\\nVolsce:\\nYou take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause\\nto be glad of yours.\\n\\nRoman:\\nWell, let us go together.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA goodly city is this Antium. City,\\n'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir\\nOf these fair edifices 'fore my wars\\nHave I heard groan and drop: then know me not,\\nLest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones\\nIn puny battle slay me.\\nSave you, sir.\\n\\nCitizen:\\nAnd you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nDirect me, if it be your will,\\nWhere great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?\\n\\nCitizen:\\nHe is, and feasts the nobles of the state\\nAt his house this night.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhich is his house, beseech you?\\n\\nCitizen:\\nThis, here before you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThank you, sir: farewell.\\nO world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,\\nWhose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,\\nWhose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,\\nAre still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love\\nUnseparable, shall within this hour,\\nOn a dissension of a doit, break out\\nTo bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,\\nWhose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,\\nTo take the one the other, by some chance,\\nSome trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends\\nAnd interjoin their issues. So with me:\\nMy birth-place hate I, and my love's upon\\nThis enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,\\nHe does fair justice; if he give me way,\\nI'll do his country service.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWine, wine, wine! What service\\nis here! I think our fellows are asleep.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWhere's Cotus? my master calls\\nfor him. Cotus!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA goodly house: the feast smells well; but I\\nAppear not like a guest.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhat would you have, friend? whence are you?\\nHere's no place for you: pray, go to the door.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI have deserved no better entertainment,\\nIn being Coriolanus.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWhence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his\\nhead; that he gives entrance to such companions?\\nPray, get you out.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAway!\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAway! get you away.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNow thou'rt troublesome.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAre you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat fellow's this?\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nA strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him\\nout of the house: prithee, call my master to him.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid\\nthe house.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLet me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat are you?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA gentleman.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nA marvellous poor one.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTrue, so I am.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nPray you, poor gentleman, take up some other\\nstation; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nFollow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhat, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a\\nstrange guest he has here.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAnd I shall.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhere dwellest thou?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nUnder the canopy.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nUnder the canopy!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhere's that?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI' the city of kites and crows.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nI' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!\\nThen thou dwellest with daws too?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNo, I serve not thy master.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nHow, sir! do you meddle with my master?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy\\nmistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy\\ntrencher, hence!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhere is this fellow?\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nHere, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for\\ndisturbing the lords within.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?\\nWhy speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nIf, Tullus,\\nNot yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not\\nThink me for the man I am, necessity\\nCommands me name myself.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhat is thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nA name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,\\nAnd harsh in sound to thine.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nSay, what's thy name?\\nThou hast a grim appearance, and thy face\\nBears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.\\nThou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nPrepare thy brow to frown: know'st\\nthou me yet?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI know thee not: thy name?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMy name is Caius Marcius, who hath done\\nTo thee particularly and to all the Volsces\\nGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness may\\nMy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,\\nThe extreme dangers and the drops of blood\\nShed for my thankless country are requited\\nBut with that surname; a good memory,\\nAnd witness of the malice and displeasure\\nWhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;\\nThe cruelty and envy of the people,\\nPermitted by our dastard nobles, who\\nHave all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;\\nAnd suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be\\nWhoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity\\nHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--\\nMistake me not--to save my life, for if\\nI had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world\\nI would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,\\nTo be full quit of those my banishers,\\nStand I before thee here. Then if thou hast\\nA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge\\nThine own particular wrongs and stop those maims\\nOf shame seen through thy country, speed\\nthee straight,\\nAnd make my misery serve thy turn: so use it\\nThat my revengeful services may prove\\nAs benefits to thee, for I will fight\\nAgainst my canker'd country with the spleen\\nOf all the under fiends. But if so be\\nThou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes\\nThou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am\\nLonger to live most weary, and present\\nMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;\\nWhich not to cut would show thee but a fool,\\nSince I have ever follow'd thee with hate,\\nDrawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,\\nAnd cannot live but to thy shame, unless\\nIt be to do thee service.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nO Marcius, Marcius!\\nEach word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart\\nA root of ancient envy. If Jupiter\\nShould from yond cloud speak divine things,\\nAnd say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more\\nThan thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine\\nMine arms about that body, where against\\nMy grained ash an hundred times hath broke\\nAnd scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip\\nThe anvil of my sword, and do contest\\nAs hotly and as nobly with thy love\\nAs ever in ambitious strength I did\\nContend against thy valour. Know thou first,\\nI loved the maid I married; never man\\nSigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,\\nThou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart\\nThan when I first my wedded mistress saw\\nBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,\\nWe have a power on foot; and I had purpose\\nOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,\\nOr lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out\\nTwelve several times, and I have nightly since\\nDreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;\\nWe have been down together in my sleep,\\nUnbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,\\nAnd waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,\\nHad we no quarrel else to Rome, but that\\nThou art thence banish'd, we would muster all\\nFrom twelve to seventy, and pouring war\\nInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,\\nLike a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,\\nAnd take our friendly senators by the hands;\\nWho now are here, taking their leaves of me,\\nWho am prepared against your territories,\\nThough not for Rome itself.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nYou bless me, gods!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nTherefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have\\nThe leading of thine own revenges, take\\nThe one half of my commission; and set down--\\nAs best thou art experienced, since thou know'st\\nThy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;\\nWhether to knock against the gates of Rome,\\nOr rudely visit them in parts remote,\\nTo fright them, ere destroy. But come in:\\nLet me commend thee first to those that shall\\nSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!\\nAnd more a friend than e'er an enemy;\\nYet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nHere's a strange alteration!\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nBy my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with\\na cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a\\nfalse report of him.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhat an arm he has! he turned me about with his\\nfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nNay, I knew by his face that there was something in\\nhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I\\ncannot tell how to term it.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nHe had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,\\nbut I thought there was more in him than I could think.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nSo did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest\\nman i' the world.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nI think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWho, my master?\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nNay, it's no matter for that.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWorth six on him.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nNay, not so neither: but I take him to be the\\ngreater soldier.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nFaith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:\\nfor the defence of a town, our general is excellent.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nAy, and for an assault too.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nO slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhat, what, what? let's partake.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nI would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as\\nlieve be a condemned man.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWherefore? wherefore?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhy, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,\\nCaius Marcius.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nWhy do you say 'thwack our general '?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nI do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always\\ngood enough for him.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nCome, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too\\nhard for him; I have heard him say so himself.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nHe was too hard for him directly, to say the troth\\non't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched\\nhim like a carbon ado.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAn he had been cannibally given, he might have\\nbroiled and eaten him too.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nBut, more of thy news?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nWhy, he is so made on here within, as if he were son\\nand heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no\\nquestion asked him by any of the senators, but they\\nstand bald before him: our general himself makes a\\nmistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and\\nturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But\\nthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'\\nthe middle and but one half of what he was\\nyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty\\nand grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,\\nand sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he\\nwill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nAnd he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nDo't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as\\nmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it\\nwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as\\nwe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nDirectitude! what's that?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nBut when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,\\nand the man in blood, they will out of their\\nburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with\\nhim.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nBut when goes this forward?\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nTo-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the\\ndrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a\\nparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they\\nwipe their lips.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\nWhy, then we shall have a stirring world again.\\nThis peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase\\ntailors, and breed ballad-makers.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nLet me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as\\nday does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and\\nfull of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;\\nmulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more\\nbastard children than war's a destroyer of men.\\n\\nSecond Servingman:\\n'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to\\nbe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a\\ngreat maker of cuckolds.\\n\\nFirst Servingman:\\nAy, and it makes men hate one another.\\n\\nThird Servingman:\\nReason; because they then less need one another.\\nThe wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap\\nas Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.\\n\\nAll:\\nIn, in, in, in!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe hear not of him, neither need we fear him;\\nHis remedies are tame i' the present peace\\nAnd quietness of the people, which before\\nWere in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends\\nBlush that the world goes well, who rather had,\\nThough they themselves did suffer by't, behold\\nDissentious numbers pestering streets than see\\nOur tradesmen with in their shops and going\\nAbout their functions friendly.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nWe stood to't in good time.\\nIs this Menenius?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nHail sir!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHail to you both!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYour Coriolanus\\nIs not much miss'd, but with his friends:\\nThe commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,\\nWere he more angry at it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAll's well; and might have been much better, if\\nHe could have temporized.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhere is he, hear you?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife\\nHear nothing from him.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nThe gods preserve you both!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGod-den, our neighbours.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGod-den to you all, god-den to you all.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nOurselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,\\nAre bound to pray for you both.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nLive, and thrive!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nFarewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus\\nHad loved you as we did.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nNow the gods keep you!\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nFarewell, farewell.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis is a happier and more comely time\\nThan when these fellows ran about the streets,\\nCrying confusion.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nCaius Marcius was\\nA worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,\\nO'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,\\nSelf-loving,--\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nAnd affecting one sole throne,\\nWithout assistance.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI think not so.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe should by this, to all our lamentation,\\nIf he had gone forth consul, found it so.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nThe gods have well prevented it, and Rome\\nSits safe and still without him.\\n\\nAEdile:\\nWorthy tribunes,\\nThere is a slave, whom we have put in prison,\\nReports, the Volsces with two several powers\\nAre enter'd in the Roman territories,\\nAnd with the deepest malice of the war\\nDestroy what lies before 'em.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n'Tis Aufidius,\\nWho, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,\\nThrusts forth his horns again into the world;\\nWhich were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,\\nAnd durst not once peep out.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nCome, what talk you\\nOf Marcius?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nGo see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be\\nThe Volsces dare break with us.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nCannot be!\\nWe have record that very well it can,\\nAnd three examples of the like have been\\nWithin my age. But reason with the fellow,\\nBefore you punish him, where he heard this,\\nLest you shall chance to whip your information\\nAnd beat the messenger who bids beware\\nOf what is to be dreaded.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nTell not me:\\nI know this cannot be.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nNot possible.\\n\\nMessenger:\\nThe nobles in great earnestness are going\\nAll to the senate-house: some news is come\\nThat turns their countenances.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\n'Tis this slave;--\\nGo whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;\\nNothing but his report.\\n\\nMessenger:\\nYes, worthy sir,\\nThe slave's report is seconded; and more,\\nMore fearful, is deliver'd.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat more fearful?\\n\\nMessenger:\\nIt is spoke freely out of many mouths--\\nHow probable I do not know--that Marcius,\\nJoin'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,\\nAnd vows revenge as spacious as between\\nThe young'st and oldest thing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThis is most likely!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nRaised only, that the weaker sort may wish\\nGood Marcius home again.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe very trick on't.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is unlikely:\\nHe and Aufidius can no more atone\\nThan violentest contrariety.\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nYou are sent for to the senate:\\nA fearful army, led by Caius Marcius\\nAssociated with Aufidius, rages\\nUpon our territories; and have already\\nO'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took\\nWhat lay before them.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nO, you have made good work!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat news? what news?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou have holp to ravish your own daughters and\\nTo melt the city leads upon your pates,\\nTo see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat's the news? what's the news?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYour temples burned in their cement, and\\nYour franchises, whereon you stood, confined\\nInto an auger's bore.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPray now, your news?\\nYou have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--\\nIf Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nIf!\\nHe is their god: he leads them like a thing\\nMade by some other deity than nature,\\nThat shapes man better; and they follow him,\\nAgainst us brats, with no less confidence\\nThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,\\nOr butchers killing flies.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have made good work,\\nYou and your apron-men; you that stood so up much\\non the voice of occupation and\\nThe breath of garlic-eaters!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHe will shake\\nYour Rome about your ears.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nAs Hercules\\nDid shake down mellow fruit.\\nYou have made fair work!\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nBut is this true, sir?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nAy; and you'll look pale\\nBefore you find it other. All the regions\\nDo smilingly revolt; and who resist\\nAre mock'd for valiant ignorance,\\nAnd perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?\\nYour enemies and his find something in him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWe are all undone, unless\\nThe noble man have mercy.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nWho shall ask it?\\nThe tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people\\nDeserve such pity of him as the wolf\\nDoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they\\nShould say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even\\nAs those should do that had deserved his hate,\\nAnd therein show'd like enemies.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\n'Tis true:\\nIf he were putting to my house the brand\\nThat should consume it, I have not the face\\nTo say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,\\nYou and your crafts! you have crafted fair!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYou have brought\\nA trembling upon Rome, such as was never\\nSo incapable of help.\\n\\nBoth Tribunes:\\nSay not we brought it.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHow! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts\\nAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,\\nWho did hoot him out o' the city.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nBut I fear\\nThey'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,\\nThe second name of men, obeys his points\\nAs if he were his officer: desperation\\nIs all the policy, strength and defence,\\nThat Rome can make against them.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHere come the clusters.\\nAnd is Aufidius with him? You are they\\nThat made the air unwholesome, when you cast\\nYour stinking greasy caps in hooting at\\nCoriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;\\nAnd not a hair upon a soldier's head\\nWhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs\\nAs you threw caps up will he tumble down,\\nAnd pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;\\nif he could burn us all into one coal,\\nWe have deserved it.\\n\\nCitizens:\\nFaith, we hear fearful news.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nFor mine own part,\\nWhen I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nAnd so did I.\\n\\nThird Citizen:\\nAnd so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very\\nmany of us: that we did, we did for the best; and\\nthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yet\\nit was against our will.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYe re goodly things, you voices!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou have made\\nGood work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nO, ay, what else?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nGo, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:\\nThese are a side that would be glad to have\\nThis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,\\nAnd show no sign of fear.\\n\\nFirst Citizen:\\nThe gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.\\nI ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished\\nhim.\\n\\nSecond Citizen:\\nSo did we all. But, come, let's home.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nI do not like this news.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNor I.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nLet's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth\\nWould buy this for a lie!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPray, let us go.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nDo they still fly to the Roman?\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nI do not know what witchcraft's in him, but\\nYour soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,\\nTheir talk at table, and their thanks at end;\\nAnd you are darken'd in this action, sir,\\nEven by your own.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI cannot help it now,\\nUnless, by using means, I lame the foot\\nOf our design. He bears himself more proudlier,\\nEven to my person, than I thought he would\\nWhen first I did embrace him: yet his nature\\nIn that's no changeling; and I must excuse\\nWhat cannot be amended.\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nYet I wish, sir,--\\nI mean for your particular,--you had not\\nJoin'd in commission with him; but either\\nHad borne the action of yourself, or else\\nTo him had left it solely.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI understand thee well; and be thou sure,\\nwhen he shall come to his account, he knows not\\nWhat I can urge against him. Although it seems,\\nAnd so he thinks, and is no less apparent\\nTo the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.\\nAnd shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,\\nFights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon\\nAs draw his sword; yet he hath left undone\\nThat which shall break his neck or hazard mine,\\nWhene'er we come to our account.\\n\\nLieutenant:\\nSir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAll places yield to him ere he sits down;\\nAnd the nobility of Rome are his:\\nThe senators and patricians love him too:\\nThe tribunes are no soldiers; and their people\\nWill be as rash in the repeal, as hasty\\nTo expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome\\nAs is the osprey to the fish, who takes it\\nBy sovereignty of nature. First he was\\nA noble servant to them; but he could not\\nCarry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,\\nWhich out of daily fortune ever taints\\nThe happy man; whether defect of judgment,\\nTo fail in the disposing of those chances\\nWhich he was lord of; or whether nature,\\nNot to be other than one thing, not moving\\nFrom the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace\\nEven with the same austerity and garb\\nAs he controll'd the war; but one of these--\\nAs he hath spices of them all, not all,\\nFor I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,\\nSo hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,\\nTo choke it in the utterance. So our virtues\\nLie in the interpretation of the time:\\nAnd power, unto itself most commendable,\\nHath not a tomb so evident as a chair\\nTo extol what it hath done.\\nOne fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;\\nRights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.\\nCome, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,\\nThou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNo, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said\\nWhich was sometime his general; who loved him\\nIn a most dear particular. He call'd me father:\\nBut what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;\\nA mile before his tent fall down, and knee\\nThe way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd\\nTo hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHe would not seem to know me.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nDo you hear?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nYet one time he did call me by my name:\\nI urged our old acquaintance, and the drops\\nThat we have bled together. Coriolanus\\nHe would not answer to: forbad all names;\\nHe was a kind of nothing, titleless,\\nTill he had forged himself a name o' the fire\\nOf burning Rome.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhy, so: you have made good work!\\nA pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,\\nTo make coals cheap,--a noble memory!\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI minded him how royal 'twas to pardon\\nWhen it was less expected: he replied,\\nIt was a bare petition of a state\\nTo one whom they had punish'd.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nVery well:\\nCould he say less?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI offer'd to awaken his regard\\nFor's private friends: his answer to me was,\\nHe could not stay to pick them in a pile\\nOf noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,\\nFor one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,\\nAnd still to nose the offence.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFor one poor grain or two!\\nI am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,\\nAnd this brave fellow too, we are the grains:\\nYou are the musty chaff; and you are smelt\\nAbove the moon: we must be burnt for you.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid\\nIn this so never-needed help, yet do not\\nUpbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you\\nWould be your country's pleader, your good tongue,\\nMore than the instant army we can make,\\nMight stop our countryman.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNo, I'll not meddle.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nPray you, go to him.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWhat should I do?\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nOnly make trial what your love can do\\nFor Rome, towards Marcius.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nWell, and say that Marcius\\nReturn me, as Cominius is return'd,\\nUnheard; what then?\\nBut as a discontented friend, grief-shot\\nWith his unkindness? say't be so?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYet your good will\\nmust have that thanks from Rome, after the measure\\nAs you intended well.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI'll undertake 't:\\nI think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip\\nAnd hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.\\nHe was not taken well; he had not dined:\\nThe veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then\\nWe pout upon the morning, are unapt\\nTo give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd\\nThese and these conveyances of our blood\\nWith wine and feeding, we have suppler souls\\nThan in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him\\nTill he be dieted to my request,\\nAnd then I'll set upon him.\\n\\nBRUTUS:\\nYou know the very road into his kindness,\\nAnd cannot lose your way.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nGood faith, I'll prove him,\\nSpeed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge\\nOf my success.\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nHe'll never hear him.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nNot?\\n\\nCOMINIUS:\\nI tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye\\nRed as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury\\nThe gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;\\n'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me\\nThus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,\\nHe sent in writing after me; what he would not,\\nBound with an oath to yield to his conditions:\\nSo that all hope is vain.\\nUnless his noble mother, and his wife;\\nWho, as I hear, mean to solicit him\\nFor mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,\\nAnd with our fair entreaties haste them on.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nStay: whence are you?\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nStand, and go back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nYou guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,\\nI am an officer of state, and come\\nTo speak with Coriolanus.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nFrom whence?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nFrom Rome.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nYou may not pass, you must return: our general\\nWill no more hear from thence.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nYou'll see your Rome embraced with fire before\\nYou'll speak with Coriolanus.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nGood my friends,\\nIf you have heard your general talk of Rome,\\nAnd of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,\\nMy name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nBe it so; go back: the virtue of your name\\nIs not here passable.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI tell thee, fellow,\\nThe general is my lover: I have been\\nThe book of his good acts, whence men have read\\nHis name unparallel'd, haply amplified;\\nFor I have ever verified my friends,\\nOf whom he's chief, with all the size that verity\\nWould without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,\\nLike to a bowl upon a subtle ground,\\nI have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise\\nHave almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,\\nI must have leave to pass.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nFaith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his\\nbehalf as you have uttered words in your own, you\\nshould not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous\\nto lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nPrithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,\\nalways factionary on the party of your general.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nHowsoever you have been his liar, as you say you\\nhave, I am one that, telling true under him, must\\nsay, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHas he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not\\nspeak with him till after dinner.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nYou are a Roman, are you?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI am, as thy general is.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nThen you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,\\nwhen you have pushed out your gates the very\\ndefender of them, and, in a violent popular\\nignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to\\nfront his revenges with the easy groans of old\\nwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with\\nthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as\\nyou seem to be? Can you think to blow out the\\nintended fire your city is ready to flame in, with\\nsuch weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;\\ntherefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your\\nexecution: you are condemned, our general has sworn\\nyou out of reprieve and pardon.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would\\nuse me with estimation.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nCome, my captain knows you not.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI mean, thy general.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nMy general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest\\nI let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's\\nthe utmost of your having: back.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNay, but, fellow, fellow,--\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat's the matter?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNow, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:\\nYou shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall\\nperceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from\\nmy son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment\\nwith him, if thou standest not i' the state of\\nhanging, or of some death more long in\\nspectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now\\npresently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.\\nThe glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy\\nparticular prosperity, and love thee no worse than\\nthy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!\\nthou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's\\nwater to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to\\nthee; but being assured none but myself could move\\nthee, I have been blown out of your gates with\\nsighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy\\npetitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy\\nwrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet\\nhere,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my\\naccess to thee.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAway!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nHow! away!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs\\nAre servanted to others: though I owe\\nMy revenge properly, my remission lies\\nIn Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,\\nIngrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather\\nThan pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.\\nMine ears against your suits are stronger than\\nYour gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,\\nTake this along; I writ it for thy sake\\nAnd would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,\\nI will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,\\nWas my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nYou keep a constant temper.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nNow, sir, is your name Menenius?\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\n'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the\\nway home again.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nDo you hear how we are shent for keeping your\\ngreatness back?\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nWhat cause, do you think, I have to swoon?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI neither care for the world nor your general: for\\nsuch things as you, I can scarce think there's any,\\nye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by\\nhimself fears it not from another: let your general\\ndo his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and\\nyour misery increase with your age! I say to you,\\nas I was said to, Away!\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nA noble fellow, I warrant him.\\n\\nSecond Senator:\\nThe worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the\\noak not to be wind-shaken.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWe will before the walls of Rome tomorrow\\nSet down our host. My partner in this action,\\nYou must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly\\nI have borne this business.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nOnly their ends\\nYou have respected; stopp'd your ears against\\nThe general suit of Rome; never admitted\\nA private whisper, no, not with such friends\\nThat thought them sure of you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThis last old man,\\nWhom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,\\nLoved me above the measure of a father;\\nNay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge\\nWas to send him; for whose old love I have,\\nThough I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd\\nThe first conditions, which they did refuse\\nAnd cannot now accept; to grace him only\\nThat thought he could do more, a very little\\nI have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,\\nNor from the state nor private friends, hereafter\\nWill I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?\\nShall I be tempted to infringe my vow\\nIn the same time 'tis made? I will not.\\nMy wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould\\nWherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand\\nThe grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!\\nAll bond and privilege of nature, break!\\nLet it be virtuous to be obstinate.\\nWhat is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,\\nWhich can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not\\nOf stronger earth than others. My mother bows;\\nAs if Olympus to a molehill should\\nIn supplication nod: and my young boy\\nHath an aspect of intercession, which\\nGreat nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces\\nPlough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never\\nBe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,\\nAs if a man were author of himself\\nAnd knew no other kin.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nMy lord and husband!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThese eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nThe sorrow that delivers us thus changed\\nMakes you think so.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nLike a dull actor now,\\nI have forgot my part, and I am out,\\nEven to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,\\nForgive my tyranny; but do not say\\nFor that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss\\nLong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!\\nNow, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss\\nI carried from thee, dear; and my true lip\\nHath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,\\nAnd the most noble mother of the world\\nLeave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;\\nOf thy deep duty more impression show\\nThan that of common sons.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, stand up blest!\\nWhilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,\\nI kneel before thee; and unproperly\\nShow duty, as mistaken all this while\\nBetween the child and parent.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nWhat is this?\\nYour knees to me? to your corrected son?\\nThen let the pebbles on the hungry beach\\nFillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds\\nStrike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;\\nMurdering impossibility, to make\\nWhat cannot be, slight work.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThou art my warrior;\\nI holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe noble sister of Publicola,\\nThe moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle\\nThat's curdied by the frost from purest snow\\nAnd hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nThis is a poor epitome of yours,\\nWhich by the interpretation of full time\\nMay show like all yourself.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThe god of soldiers,\\nWith the consent of supreme Jove, inform\\nThy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove\\nTo shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars\\nLike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,\\nAnd saving those that eye thee!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nYour knee, sirrah.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nThat's my brave boy!\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nEven he, your wife, this lady, and myself,\\nAre suitors to you.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI beseech you, peace:\\nOr, if you'ld ask, remember this before:\\nThe thing I have forsworn to grant may never\\nBe held by you denials. Do not bid me\\nDismiss my soldiers, or capitulate\\nAgain with Rome's mechanics: tell me not\\nWherein I seem unnatural: desire not\\nTo ally my rages and revenges with\\nYour colder reasons.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nO, no more, no more!\\nYou have said you will not grant us any thing;\\nFor we have nothing else to ask, but that\\nWhich you deny already: yet we will ask;\\nThat, if you fail in our request, the blame\\nMay hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll\\nHear nought from Rome in private. Your request?\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nShould we be silent and not speak, our raiment\\nAnd state of bodies would bewray what life\\nWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyself\\nHow more unfortunate than all living women\\nAre we come hither: since that thy sight,\\nwhich should\\nMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance\\nwith comforts,\\nConstrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;\\nMaking the mother, wife and child to see\\nThe son, the husband and the father tearing\\nHis country's bowels out. And to poor we\\nThine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us\\nOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfort\\nThat all but we enjoy; for how can we,\\nAlas, how can we for our country pray.\\nWhereto we are bound, together with thy victory,\\nWhereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose\\nThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,\\nOur comfort in the country. We must find\\nAn evident calamity, though we had\\nOur wish, which side should win: for either thou\\nMust, as a foreign recreant, be led\\nWith manacles thorough our streets, or else\\ntriumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,\\nAnd bear the palm for having bravely shed\\nThy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,\\nI purpose not to wait on fortune till\\nThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee\\nRather to show a noble grace to both parts\\nThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner\\nMarch to assault thy country than to tread--\\nTrust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,\\nThat brought thee to this world.\\n\\nVIRGILIA:\\nAy, and mine,\\nThat brought you forth this boy, to keep your name\\nLiving to time.\\n\\nYoung MARCIUS:\\nA' shall not tread on me;\\nI'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nNot of a woman's tenderness to be,\\nRequires nor child nor woman's face to see.\\nI have sat too long.\\n\\nVOLUMNIA:\\nNay, go not from us thus.\\nIf it were so that our request did tend\\nTo save the Romans, thereby to destroy\\nThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,\\nAs poisonous of your honour: no; our suit\\nIs that you reconcile them: while the Volsces\\nMay say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,\\n'This we received;' and each in either side\\nGive the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest\\nFor making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,\\nThe end of war's uncertain, but this certain,\\nThat, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\\nWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,\\nWhose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;\\nWhose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,\\nBut with his last attempt he wiped it out;\\nDestroy'd his country, and his name remains\\nTo the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:\\nThou hast affected the fine strains of honour,\\nTo imitate the graces of the gods;\\nTo tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,\\nAnd yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\\nThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?\\nThink'st thou it honourable for a noble man\\nStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:\\nHe cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:\\nPerhaps thy childishness will move him more\\nThan can our reasons. There's no man in the world\\nMore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate\\nLike one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life\\nShow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,\\nWhen she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\\nHas cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,\\nLoaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,\\nAnd spurn me back: but if it be not so,\\nThou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,\\nThat thou restrain'st from me the duty which\\nTo a mother's part belongs. He turns away:\\nDown, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.\\nTo his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride\\nThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;\\nThis is the last: so we will home to Rome,\\nAnd die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:\\nThis boy, that cannot tell what he would have\\nBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,\\nDoes reason our petition with more strength\\nThan thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:\\nThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\\nHis wife is in Corioli and his child\\nLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:\\nI am hush'd until our city be a-fire,\\nAnd then I'll speak a little.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO mother, mother!\\nWhat have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,\\nThe gods look down, and this unnatural scene\\nThey laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!\\nYou have won a happy victory to Rome;\\nBut, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,\\nMost dangerously you have with him prevail'd,\\nIf not most mortal to him. But, let it come.\\nAufidius, though I cannot make true wars,\\nI'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,\\nWere you in my stead, would you have heard\\nA mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI was moved withal.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nI dare be sworn you were:\\nAnd, sir, it is no little thing to make\\nMine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,\\nWhat peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,\\nI'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,\\nStand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nAy, by and by;\\nBut we will drink together; and you shall bear\\nA better witness back than words, which we,\\nOn like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.\\nCome, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve\\nTo have a temple built you: all the swords\\nIn Italy, and her confederate arms,\\nCould not have made this peace.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSee you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond\\ncorner-stone?\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhy, what of that?\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nIf it be possible for you to displace it with your\\nlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies of\\nRome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.\\nBut I say there is no hope in't: our throats are\\nsentenced and stay upon execution.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nIs't possible that so short a time can alter the\\ncondition of a man!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThere is differency between a grub and a butterfly;\\nyet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown\\nfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a\\ncreeping thing.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nHe loved his mother dearly.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nSo did he me: and he no more remembers his mother\\nnow than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness\\nof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he\\nmoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before\\nhis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with\\nhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a\\nbattery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for\\nAlexander. What he bids be done is finished with\\nhis bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity\\nand a heaven to throne in.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nYes, mercy, if you report him truly.\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nI paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his\\nmother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy\\nin him than there is milk in a male tiger; that\\nshall our poor city find: and all this is long of\\nyou.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThe gods be good unto us!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nNo, in such a case the gods will not be good unto\\nus. When we banished him, we respected not them;\\nand, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.\\n\\nMessenger:\\nSir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:\\nThe plebeians have got your fellow-tribune\\nAnd hale him up and down, all swearing, if\\nThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,\\nThey'll give him death by inches.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWhat's the news?\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nGood news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,\\nThe Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:\\nA merrier day did never yet greet Rome,\\nNo, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFriend,\\nArt thou certain this is true? is it most certain?\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nAs certain as I know the sun is fire:\\nWhere have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?\\nNe'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,\\nAs the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!\\nThe trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,\\nTabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,\\nMake the sun dance. Hark you!\\n\\nMENENIUS:\\nThis is good news:\\nI will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia\\nIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians,\\nA city full; of tribunes, such as you,\\nA sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:\\nThis morning for ten thousand of your throats\\nI'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nFirst, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,\\nAccept my thankfulness.\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nSir, we have all\\nGreat cause to give great thanks.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nThey are near the city?\\n\\nSecond Messenger:\\nAlmost at point to enter.\\n\\nSICINIUS:\\nWe will meet them,\\nAnd help the joy.\\n\\nFirst Senator:\\nBehold our patroness, the life of Rome!\\nCall all your tribes together, praise the gods,\\nAnd make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:\\nUnshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,\\nRepeal him with the welcome of his mother;\\nCry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'\\n\\nAll:\\nWelcome, ladies, Welcome!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nGo tell the lords o' the city I am here:\\nDeliver them this paper: having read it,\\nBid them repair to the market place; where I,\\nEven in theirs and in the commons' ears,\\nWill vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse\\nThe city ports by this hath enter'd and\\nIntends to appear before the people, hoping\\nTo purge herself with words: dispatch.\\nMost welcome!\\n\\nFirst Conspirator:\\nHow is it with our general?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nEven so\\nAs with a man by his own alms empoison'd,\\nAnd with his charity slain.\\n\\nSecond Conspirator:\\nMost noble sir,\\nIf you do hold the same intent wherein\\nYou wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you\\nOf your great danger.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nSir, I cannot tell:\\nWe must proceed as we do find the people.\\n\\nThird Conspirator:\\nThe people will remain uncertain whilst\\n'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either\\nMakes the survivor heir of all.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI know it;\\nAnd my pretext to strike at him admits\\nA good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd\\nMine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,\\nHe water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,\\nSeducing so my friends; and, to this end,\\nHe bow'd his nature, never known before\\nBut to be rough, unswayable and free.\\n\\nThird Conspirator:\\nSir, his stoutness\\nWhen he did stand for consul, which he lost\\nBy lack of stooping,--\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nThat I would have spoke of:\\nBeing banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;\\nPresented to my knife his throat: I took him;\\nMade him joint-servant with me; gave him way\\nIn all his own desires; nay, let him choose\\nOut of my files, his projects to accomplish,\\nMy best and freshest men; served his designments\\nIn mine own person; holp to reap the fame\\nWhich he did end all his; and took some pride\\nTo do myself this wrong: till, at the last,\\nI seem'd his follower, not partner, and\\nHe waged me with his countenance, as if\\nI had been mercenary.\\n\\nFirst Conspirator:\\nSo he did, my lord:\\nThe army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,\\nWhen he had carried Rome and that we look'd\\nFor no less spoil than glory,--\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nThere was it:\\nFor which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.\\nAt a few drops of women's rheum, which are\\nAs cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour\\nOf our great action: therefore shall he die,\\nAnd I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!\\n\\nFirst Conspirator:\\nYour native town you enter'd like a post,\\nAnd had no welcomes home: but he returns,\\nSplitting the air with noise.\\n\\nSecond Conspirator:\\nAnd patient fools,\\nWhose children he hath slain, their base throats tear\\nWith giving him glory.\\n\\nThird Conspirator:\\nTherefore, at your vantage,\\nEre he express himself, or move the people\\nWith what he would say, let him feel your sword,\\nWhich we will second. When he lies along,\\nAfter your way his tale pronounced shall bury\\nHis reasons with his body.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nSay no more:\\nHere come the lords.\\n\\nAll The Lords:\\nYou are most welcome home.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nI have not deserved it.\\nBut, worthy lords, have you with heed perused\\nWhat I have written to you?\\n\\nLords:\\nWe have.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nAnd grieve to hear't.\\nWhat faults he made before the last, I think\\nMight have found easy fines: but there to end\\nWhere he was to begin and give away\\nThe benefit of our levies, answering us\\nWith our own charge, making a treaty where\\nThere was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nHe approaches: you shall hear him.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,\\nNo more infected with my country's love\\nThan when I parted hence, but still subsisting\\nUnder your great command. You are to know\\nThat prosperously I have attempted and\\nWith bloody passage led your wars even to\\nThe gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home\\nDo more than counterpoise a full third part\\nThe charges of the action. We have made peace\\nWith no less honour to the Antiates\\nThan shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,\\nSubscribed by the consuls and patricians,\\nTogether with the seal o' the senate, what\\nWe have compounded on.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nRead it not, noble lords;\\nBut tell the traitor, in the high'st degree\\nHe hath abused your powers.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nTraitor! how now!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAy, traitor, Marcius!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMarcius!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nAy, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think\\nI'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name\\nCoriolanus in Corioli?\\nYou lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously\\nHe has betray'd your business, and given up,\\nFor certain drops of salt, your city Rome,\\nI say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;\\nBreaking his oath and resolution like\\nA twist of rotten silk, never admitting\\nCounsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears\\nHe whined and roar'd away your victory,\\nThat pages blush'd at him and men of heart\\nLook'd wondering each at other.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHear'st thou, Mars?\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nName not the god, thou boy of tears!\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nHa!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nNo more.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nMeasureless liar, thou hast made my heart\\nToo great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!\\nPardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever\\nI was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,\\nMust give this cur the lie: and his own notion--\\nWho wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that\\nMust bear my beating to his grave--shall join\\nTo thrust the lie unto him.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nPeace, both, and hear me speak.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nCut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,\\nStain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!\\nIf you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,\\nThat, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I\\nFlutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:\\nAlone I did it. Boy!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nWhy, noble lords,\\nWill you be put in mind of his blind fortune,\\nWhich was your shame, by this unholy braggart,\\n'Fore your own eyes and ears?\\n\\nAll Conspirators:\\nLet him die for't.\\n\\nAll The People:\\n'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd\\nmy son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin\\nMarcus.' 'He killed my father.'\\n\\nSecond Lord:\\nPeace, ho! no outrage: peace!\\nThe man is noble and his fame folds-in\\nThis orb o' the earth. His last offences to us\\nShall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,\\nAnd trouble not the peace.\\n\\nCORIOLANUS:\\nO that I had him,\\nWith six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,\\nTo use my lawful sword!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nInsolent villain!\\n\\nAll Conspirators:\\nKill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!\\n\\nLords:\\nHold, hold, hold, hold!\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nMy noble masters, hear me speak.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nO Tullus,--\\n\\nSecond Lord:\\nThou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.\\n\\nThird Lord:\\nTread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;\\nPut up your swords.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nMy lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,\\nProvoked by him, you cannot--the great danger\\nWhich this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice\\nThat he is thus cut off. Please it your honours\\nTo call me to your senate, I'll deliver\\nMyself your loyal servant, or endure\\nYour heaviest censure.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBear from hence his body;\\nAnd mourn you for him: let him be regarded\\nAs the most noble corse that ever herald\\nDid follow to his urn.\\n\\nSecond Lord:\\nHis own impatience\\nTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.\\nLet's make the best of it.\\n\\nAUFIDIUS:\\nMy rage is gone;\\nAnd I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.\\nHelp, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.\\nBeat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:\\nTrail your steel pikes. Though in this city he\\nHath widow'd and unchilded many a one,\\nWhich to this hour bewail the injury,\\nYet he shall have a noble memory.

How say you?\\nMy prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'\\nOne of them you shall be.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nYour guest, then, madam:\\nTo be your prisoner should import offending;\\nWhich is for me less easy to commit\\nThan you to punish.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNot your gaoler, then,\\nBut your kind hostess.

Had we pursued that life,\\nAnd our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd\\nWith stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven\\nBoldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd\\nHereditary ours.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nBy this we gather\\nYou have tripp'd since.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO my most sacred lady!\\nTemptations have since then been born to's; for\\nIn those unfledged days was my wife a girl;\\nYour precious self had then not cross'd the eyes\\nOf my young play-fellow.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nGrace to boot!\\nOf this make no conclusion, lest you say\\nYour queen and I are devils: yet go on;\\nThe offences we have made you do we'll answer,\\nIf you first sinn'd with us and that with us\\nYou did continue fault and that you slipp'd not\\nWith any but with us.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIs he won yet?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nHe'll stay my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAt my request he would not.\\nHermione, my dearest, thou never spokest\\nTo better purpose.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNever?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNever, but once.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat! have I twice said well? when was't before?\\nI prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's\\nAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless\\nSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\\nOur praises are our wages: you may ride's\\nWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\\nWith spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:\\nMy last good deed was to entreat his stay:\\nWhat was my first? it has an elder sister,\\nOr I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\\nBut once before I spoke to the purpose: when?\\nNay, let me have't; I long.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, that was when\\nThree crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,\\nEre I could make thee open thy white hand\\nAnd clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter\\n'I am yours for ever.'\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\n'Tis grace indeed.\\nWhy, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:\\nThe one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\\nThe other for some while a friend.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI' fecks!\\nWhy, that's my bawcock. What, hast\\nsmutch'd thy nose?\\nThey say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\\nWe must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:\\nAnd yet the steer, the heifer and the calf\\nAre all call'd neat.--Still virginalling\\nUpon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!\\nArt thou my calf?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nYes, if you will, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,\\nTo be full like me: yet they say we are\\nAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,\\nThat will say anything but were they false\\nAs o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false\\nAs dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes\\nNo bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true\\nTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\\nLook on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\\nMost dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--\\nAffection! thy intention stabs the centre:\\nThou dost make possible things not so held,\\nCommunicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--\\nWith what's unreal thou coactive art,\\nAnd fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent\\nThou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,\\nAnd that beyond commission, and I find it,\\nAnd that to the infection of my brains\\nAnd hardening of my brows.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat means Sicilia?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nHe something seems unsettled.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow, my lord!\\nWhat cheer? how is't with you, best brother?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nYou look as if you held a brow of much distraction\\nAre you moved, my lord?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, in good earnest.\\nHow sometimes nature will betray its folly,\\nIts tenderness, and make itself a pastime\\nTo harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\\nOf my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\\nTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,\\nIn my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,\\nLest it should bite its master, and so prove,\\nAs ornaments oft do, too dangerous:\\nHow like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\\nThis squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\\nWill you take eggs for money?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNo, my lord, I'll fight.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,\\nAre you so fond of your young prince as we\\nDo seem to be of ours?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nIf at home, sir,\\nHe's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,\\nNow my sworn friend and then mine enemy,\\nMy parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:\\nHe makes a July's day short as December,\\nAnd with his varying childness cures in me\\nThoughts that would thick my blood.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSo stands this squire\\nOfficed with me: we two will walk, my lord,\\nAnd leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\\nHow thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;\\nLet what is dear in Sicily be cheap:\\nNext to thyself and my young rover, he's\\nApparent to my heart.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nIf you would seek us,\\nWe are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,\\nBe you beneath the sky.\\nI am angling now,\\nThough you perceive me not how I give line.\\nGo to, go to!\\nHow she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\\nAnd arms her with the boldness of a wife\\nTo her allowing husband!\\nGone already!\\nInch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and\\nears a fork'd one!\\nGo, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I\\nPlay too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue\\nWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour\\nWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.\\nThere have been,\\nOr I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;\\nAnd many a man there is, even at this present,\\nNow while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,\\nThat little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence\\nAnd his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by\\nSir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't\\nWhiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,\\nAs mine, against their will. Should all despair\\nThat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\\nWould hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;\\nIt is a bawdy planet, that will strike\\nWhere 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,\\nFrom east, west, north and south: be it concluded,\\nNo barricado for a belly; know't;\\nIt will let in and out the enemy\\nWith bag and baggage: many thousand on's\\nHave the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nI am like you, they say.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\\nCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDidst note it?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe would not stay at your petitions: made\\nHis business more material.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDidst perceive it?\\nThey're here with me already, whispering, rounding\\n'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,\\nWhen I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,\\nThat he did stay?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nAt the good queen's entreaty.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAt the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent\\nBut, so it is, it is not. Was this taken\\nBy any understanding pate but thine?\\nFor thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\\nMore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,\\nBut of the finer natures? by some severals\\nOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\\nPerchance are to this business purblind? say.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBusiness, my lord! I think most understand\\nBohemia stays here longer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHa!\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nStays here longer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAy, but why?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nTo satisfy your highness and the entreaties\\nOf our most gracious mistress.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSatisfy!\\nThe entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!\\nLet that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\\nWith all the nearest things to my heart, as well\\nMy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\\nHast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed\\nThy penitent reform'd: but we have been\\nDeceived in thy integrity, deceived\\nIn that which seems so.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBe it forbid, my lord!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,\\nIf thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,\\nWhich hoxes honesty behind, restraining\\nFrom course required; or else thou must be counted\\nA servant grafted in my serious trust\\nAnd therein negligent; or else a fool\\nThat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\\nAnd takest it all for jest.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy gracious lord,\\nI may be negligent, foolish and fearful;\\nIn every one of these no man is free,\\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\\nIt was my folly; if industriously\\nI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\\nWhere of the execution did cry out\\nAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fear\\nWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,\\nAre such allow'd infirmities that honesty\\nIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,\\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\\n'Tis none of mine.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHa' not you seen, Camillo,--\\nBut that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass\\nIs thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--\\nFor to a vision so apparent rumour\\nCannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation\\nResides not in that man that does not think,--\\nMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\\nOr else be impudently negative,\\nTo have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\\nMy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\\nAs rank as any flax-wench that puts to\\nBefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\\nMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,\\nYou never spoke what did become you less\\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\\nAs deep as that, though true.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIs whispering nothing?\\nIs leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\\nKissing with inside lip? stopping the career\\nOf laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible\\nOf breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?\\nSkulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?\\nHours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes\\nBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\\nThat would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?\\nWhy, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\\nThe covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\\nMy wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\\nIf this be nothing.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nGood my lord, be cured\\nOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;\\nFor 'tis most dangerous.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSay it be, 'tis true.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNo, no, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIt is; you lie, you lie:\\nI say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\\nPronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\\nOr else a hovering temporizer, that\\nCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\\nInclining to them both: were my wife's liver\\nInfected as her life, she would not live\\nThe running of one glass.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWho does infect her?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, he that wears her like a medal, hanging\\nAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\\nHad servants true about me, that bare eyes\\nTo see alike mine honour as their profits,\\nTheir own particular thrifts, they would do that\\nWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\\nHis cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form\\nHave benched and reared to worship, who mayst see\\nPlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\\nHow I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,\\nTo give mine enemy a lasting wink;\\nWhich draught to me were cordial.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, my lord,\\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\\nBut with a lingering dram that should not work\\nMaliciously like poison: but I cannot\\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\\nI have loved thee,--\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMake that thy question, and go rot!\\nDost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\\nTo appoint myself in this vexation, sully\\nThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,\\nWhich to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\\nIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,\\nGive scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,\\nWho I do think is mine and love as mine,\\nWithout ripe moving to't? Would I do this?\\nCould man so blench?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI must believe you, sir:\\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\\nProvided that, when he's removed, your highness\\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\\nEven for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\\nKnown and allied to yours.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou dost advise me\\nEven so as I mine own course have set down:\\nI'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy lord,\\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:\\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\\nAccount me not your servant.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThis is all:\\nDo't and thou hast the one half of my heart;\\nDo't not, thou split'st thine own.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI'll do't, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\\nOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\\nIs the obedience to a master, one\\nWho in rebellion with himself will have\\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\\nAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since\\nNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,\\nLet villany itself forswear't. I must\\nForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain\\nTo me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!\\nHere comes Bohemia.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is strange: methinks\\nMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\\nGood day, Camillo.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHail, most royal sir!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat is the news i' the court?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNone rare, my lord.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThe king hath on him such a countenance\\nAs he had lost some province and a region\\nLoved as he loves himself: even now I met him\\nWith customary compliment; when he,\\nWafting his eyes to the contrary and falling\\nA lip of much contempt, speeds from me and\\nSo leaves me to consider what is breeding\\nThat changeth thus his manners.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI dare not know, my lord.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?\\nBe intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;\\nFor, to yourself, what you do know, you must.\\nAnd cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,\\nYour changed complexions are to me a mirror\\nWhich shows me mine changed too; for I must be\\nA party in this alteration, finding\\nMyself thus alter'd with 't.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThere is a sickness\\nWhich puts some of us in distemper, but\\nI cannot name the disease; and it is caught\\nOf you that yet are well.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow! caught of me!\\nMake me not sighted like the basilisk:\\nI have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better\\nBy my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--\\nAs you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\\nClerk-like experienced, which no less adorns\\nOur gentry than our parents' noble names,\\nIn whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,\\nIf you know aught which does behove my knowledge\\nThereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\\nIn ignorant concealment.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI may not answer.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nA sickness caught of me, and yet I well!\\nI must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\\nI conjure thee, by all the parts of man\\nWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\\nIs not this suit of mine, that thou declare\\nWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm\\nIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\\nWhich way to be prevented, if to be;\\nIf not, how best to bear it.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, I will tell you;\\nSince I am charged in honour and by him\\nThat I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,\\nWhich must be even as swiftly follow'd as\\nI mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\\nCry lost, and so good night!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nOn, good Camillo.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI am appointed him to murder you.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nBy whom, Camillo?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBy the king.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nFor what?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\\nAs he had seen't or been an instrument\\nTo vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\\nForbiddenly.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO, then my best blood turn\\nTo an infected jelly and my name\\nBe yoked with his that did betray the Best!\\nTurn then my freshest reputation to\\nA savour that may strike the dullest nostril\\nWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\\nNay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\\nThat e'er was heard or read!\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSwear his thought over\\nBy each particular star in heaven and\\nBy all their influences, you may as well\\nForbid the sea for to obey the moon\\nAs or by oath remove or counsel shake\\nThe fabric of his folly, whose foundation\\nIs piled upon his faith and will continue\\nThe standing of his body.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow should this grow?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to\\nAvoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\\nIf therefore you dare trust my honesty,\\nThat lies enclosed in this trunk which you\\nShall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!\\nYour followers I will whisper to the business,\\nAnd will by twos and threes at several posterns\\nClear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put\\nMy fortunes to your service, which are here\\nBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;\\nFor, by the honour of my parents, I\\nHave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,\\nI dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\\nThan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon\\nHis execution sworn.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI do believe thee:\\nI saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:\\nBe pilot to me and thy places shall\\nStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready and\\nMy people did expect my hence departure\\nTwo days ago. This jealousy\\nIs for a precious creature: as she's rare,\\nMust it be great, and as his person's mighty,\\nMust it be violent, and as he does conceive\\nHe is dishonour'd by a man which ever\\nProfess'd to him, why, his revenges must\\nIn that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:\\nGood expedition be my friend, and comfort\\nThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\\nOf his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;\\nI will respect thee as a father if\\nThou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nIt is in mine authority to command\\nThe keys of all the posterns: please your highness\\nTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\\n'Tis past enduring.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nCome, my gracious lord,\\nShall I be your playfellow?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNo, I'll none of you.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nWhy, my sweet lord?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nYou'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if\\nI were a baby still. I love you better.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nAnd why so, my lord?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNot for because\\nYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\\nBecome some women best, so that there be not\\nToo much hair there, but in a semicircle\\nOr a half-moon made with a pen.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nWho taught you this?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nI learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now\\nWhat colour are your eyebrows?\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nBlue, my lord.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose\\nThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nHark ye;\\nThe queen your mother rounds apace: we shall\\nPresent our services to a fine new prince\\nOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,\\nIf we would have you.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nShe is spread of late\\nInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\\nI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\\nAnd tell 's a tale.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nMerry or sad shall't be?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nAs merry as you will.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nA sad tale's best for winter: I have one\\nOf sprites and goblins.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nLet's have that, good sir.\\nCome on, sit down: come on, and do your best\\nTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nThere was a man--\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNay, come, sit down; then on.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nDwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;\\nYond crickets shall not hear it.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nCome on, then,\\nAnd give't me in mine ear.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWas he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBehind the tuft of pines I met them; never\\nSaw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them\\nEven to their ships.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow blest am I\\nIn my just censure, in my true opinion!\\nAlack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed\\nIn being so blest! There may be in the cup\\nA spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,\\nAnd yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\\nIs not infected: but if one present\\nThe abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known\\nHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\\nWith violent hefts. I have drunk,\\nand seen the spider.\\nCamillo was his help in this, his pander:\\nThere is a plot against my life, my crown;\\nAll's true that is mistrusted: that false villain\\nWhom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:\\nHe has discover'd my design, and I\\nRemain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick\\nFor them to play at will. How came the posterns\\nSo easily open?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBy his great authority;\\nWhich often hath no less prevail'd than so\\nOn your command.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI know't too well.\\nGive me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:\\nThough he does bear some signs of me, yet you\\nHave too much blood in him.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat is this? sport?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nBear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;\\nAway with him! and let her sport herself\\nWith that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes\\nHas made thee swell thus.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nBut I'ld say he had not,\\nAnd I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\\nHowe'er you lean to the nayward.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou, my lords,\\nLook on her, mark her well; be but about\\nTo say 'she is a goodly lady,' and\\nThe justice of your bearts will thereto add\\n'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'\\nPraise her but for this her without-door form,\\nWhich on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\\nThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\\nThat calumny doth use--O, I am out--\\nThat mercy does, for calumny will sear\\nVirtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,\\nWhen you have said 'she's goodly,' come between\\nEre you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,\\nFrom him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\\nShe's an adulteress.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nShould a villain say so,\\nThe most replenish'd villain in the world,\\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\\nDo but mistake.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou have mistook, my lady,\\nPolixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!\\nWhich I'll not call a creature of thy place,\\nLest barbarism, making me the precedent,\\nShould a like language use to all degrees\\nAnd mannerly distinguishment leave out\\nBetwixt the prince and beggar: I have said\\nShe's an adulteress; I have said with whom:\\nMore, she's a traitor and Camillo is\\nA federary with her, and one that knows\\nWhat she should shame to know herself\\nBut with her most vile principal, that she's\\nA bed-swerver, even as bad as those\\nThat vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy\\nTo this their late escape.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNo, by my life.\\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\\nYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\\nYou did mistake.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo; if I mistake\\nIn those foundations which I build upon,\\nThe centre is not big enough to bear\\nA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!\\nHe who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\\nBut that he speaks.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThere's some ill planet reigns:\\nI must be patient till the heavens look\\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\\nThe king's will be perform'd!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nShall I be heard?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWho is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\\nMy women may be with me; for you see\\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\\nHas deserved prison, then abound in tears\\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\\nI never wish'd to see you sorry; now\\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo, do our bidding; hence!\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBeseech your highness, call the queen again.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nBe certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\\nProve violence; in the which three great ones suffer,\\nYourself, your queen, your son.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nFor her, my lord,\\nI dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,\\nPlease you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\\nI' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,\\nIn this which you accuse her.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIf it prove\\nShe's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where\\nI lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;\\nThan when I feel and see her no farther trust her;\\nFor every inch of woman in the world,\\nAy, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHold your peaces.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nGood my lord,--\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIt is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\\nYou are abused and by some putter-on\\nThat will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,\\nI would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,\\nI have three daughters; the eldest is eleven\\nThe second and the third, nine, and some five;\\nIf this prove true, they'll pay for't:\\nby mine honour,\\nI'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,\\nTo bring false generations: they are co-heirs;\\nAnd I had rather glib myself than they\\nShould not produce fair issue.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nCease; no more.\\nYou smell this business with a sense as cold\\nAs is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't\\nAs you feel doing thus; and see withal\\nThe instruments that feel.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIf it be so,\\nWe need no grave to bury honesty:\\nThere's not a grain of it the face to sweeten\\nOf the whole dungy earth.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat! lack I credit?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nI had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\\nUpon this ground; and more it would content me\\nTo have her honour true than your suspicion,\\nBe blamed for't how you might.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, what need we\\nCommune with you of this, but rather follow\\nOur forceful instigation? Our prerogative\\nCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\\nImparts this; which if you, or stupefied\\nOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\\nRelish a truth like us, inform yourselves\\nWe need no more of your advice: the matter,\\nThe loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all\\nProperly ours.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nAnd I wish, my liege,\\nYou had only in your silent judgment tried it,\\nWithout more overture.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow could that be?\\nEither thou art most ignorant by age,\\nOr thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,\\nAdded to their familiarity,\\nWhich was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,\\nThat lack'd sight only, nought for approbation\\nBut only seeing, all other circumstances\\nMade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:\\nYet, for a greater confirmation,\\nFor in an act of this importance 'twere\\nMost piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post\\nTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,\\nCleomenes and Dion, whom you know\\nOf stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle\\nThey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,\\nShall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nWell done, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThough I am satisfied and need no more\\nThan what I know, yet shall the oracle\\nGive rest to the minds of others, such as he\\nWhose ignorant credulity will not\\nCome up to the truth. So have we thought it good\\nFrom our free person she should be confined,\\nLest that the treachery of the two fled hence\\nBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;\\nWe are to speak in public; for this business\\nWill raise us all.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThe keeper of the prison, call to him;\\nlet him have knowledge who I am.\\nGood lady,\\nNo court in Europe is too good for thee;\\nWhat dost thou then in prison?\\nNow, good sir,\\nYou know me, do you not?\\n\\nGaoler:\\nFor a worthy lady\\nAnd one whom much I honour.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nPray you then,\\nConduct me to the queen.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nI may not, madam:\\nTo the contrary I have express commandment.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHere's ado,\\nTo lock up honesty and honour from\\nThe access of gentle visitors!\\nIs't lawful, pray you,\\nTo see her women? any of them? Emilia?\\n\\nGaoler:\\nSo please you, madam,\\nTo put apart these your attendants, I\\nShall bring Emilia forth.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI pray now, call her.\\nWithdraw yourselves.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nAnd, madam,\\nI must be present at your conference.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWell, be't so, prithee.\\nHere's such ado to make no stain a stain\\nAs passes colouring.\\nDear gentlewoman,\\nHow fares our gracious lady?\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nAs well as one so great and so forlorn\\nMay hold together: on her frights and griefs,\\nWhich never tender lady hath born greater,\\nShe is something before her time deliver'd.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nA boy?\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nA daughter, and a goodly babe,\\nLusty and like to live: the queen receives\\nMuch comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,\\nI am innocent as you.'\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI dare be sworn\\nThese dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,\\nbeshrew them!\\nHe must be told on't, and he shall: the office\\nBecomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:\\nIf I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister\\nAnd never to my red-look'd anger be\\nThe trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,\\nCommend my best obedience to the queen:\\nIf she dares trust me with her little babe,\\nI'll show't the king and undertake to be\\nHer advocate to the loud'st. We do not know\\nHow he may soften at the sight o' the child:\\nThe silence often of pure innocence\\nPersuades when speaking fails.\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nMost worthy madam,\\nYour honour and your goodness is so evident\\nThat your free undertaking cannot miss\\nA thriving issue: there is no lady living\\nSo meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship\\nTo visit the next room, I'll presently\\nAcquaint the queen of your most noble offer;\\nWho but to-day hammer'd of this design,\\nBut durst not tempt a minister of honour,\\nLest she should be denied.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nTell her, Emilia.\\nI'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't\\nAs boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted\\nI shall do good.\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nNow be you blest for it!\\nI'll to the queen: please you,\\ncome something nearer.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nMadam, if't please the queen to send the babe,\\nI know not what I shall incur to pass it,\\nHaving no warrant.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nYou need not fear it, sir:\\nThis child was prisoner to the womb and is\\nBy law and process of great nature thence\\nFreed and enfranchised, not a party to\\nThe anger of the king nor guilty of,\\nIf any be, the trespass of the queen.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nI do believe it.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nDo not you fear: upon mine honour,\\nI will stand betwixt you and danger.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\\nTo bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If\\nThe cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,\\nShe the adulteress; for the harlot king\\nIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\\nAnd level of my brain, plot-proof; but she\\nI can hook to me: say that she were gone,\\nGiven to the fire, a moiety of my rest\\nMight come to me again. Who's there?\\n\\nFirst Servant:\\nMy lord?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow does the boy?\\n\\nFirst Servant:\\nHe took good rest to-night;\\n'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo see his nobleness!\\nConceiving the dishonour of his mother,\\nHe straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,\\nFasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,\\nThrew off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\\nAnd downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,\\nSee how he fares.\\nFie, fie! no thought of him:\\nThe thought of my revenges that way\\nRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\\nAnd in his parties, his alliance; let him be\\nUntil a time may serve: for present vengeance,\\nTake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\\nLaugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:\\nThey should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\\nShall she within my power.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nYou must not enter.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\\nFear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\\nThan the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,\\nMore free than he is jealous.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nThat's enough.\\n\\nSecond Servant:\\nMadam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\\nNone should come at him.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNot so hot, good sir:\\nI come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,\\nThat creep like shadows by him and do sigh\\nAt each his needless heavings, such as you\\nNourish the cause of his awaking: I\\nDo come with words as medicinal as true,\\nHonest as either, to purge him of that humour\\nThat presses him from sleep.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat noise there, ho?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNo noise, my lord; but needful conference\\nAbout some gossips for your highness.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow!\\nAway with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\\nI charged thee that she should not come about me:\\nI knew she would.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI told her so, my lord,\\nOn your displeasure's peril and on mine,\\nShe should not visit you.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat, canst not rule her?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nFrom all dishonesty he can: in this,\\nUnless he take the course that you have done,\\nCommit me for committing honour, trust it,\\nHe shall not rule me.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nLa you now, you hear:\\nWhen she will take the rein I let her run;\\nBut she'll not stumble.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood my liege, I come;\\nAnd, I beseech you, hear me, who profess\\nMyself your loyal servant, your physician,\\nYour most obedient counsellor, yet that dare\\nLess appear so in comforting your evils,\\nThan such as most seem yours: I say, I come\\nFrom your good queen.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGood queen!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood queen, my lord,\\nGood queen; I say good queen;\\nAnd would by combat make her good, so were I\\nA man, the worst about you.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nForce her hence.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;\\nBut first I'll do my errand. The good queen,\\nFor she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;\\nHere 'tis; commends it to your blessing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOut!\\nA mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:\\nA most intelligencing bawd!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNot so:\\nI am as ignorant in that as you\\nIn so entitling me, and no less honest\\nThan you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,\\nAs this world goes, to pass for honest.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTraitors!\\nWill you not push her out? Give her the bastard.\\nThou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted\\nBy thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;\\nTake't up, I say; give't to thy crone.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nFor ever\\nUnvenerable be thy hands, if thou\\nTakest up the princess by that forced baseness\\nWhich he has put upon't!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHe dreads his wife.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nSo I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt\\nYou'ld call your children yours.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA nest of traitors!\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI am none, by this good light.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNor I, nor any\\nBut one that's here, and that's himself, for he\\nThe sacred honour of himself, his queen's,\\nHis hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,\\nWhose sting is sharper than the sword's;\\nand will not--\\nFor, as the case now stands, it is a curse\\nHe cannot be compell'd to't--once remove\\nThe root of his opinion, which is rotten\\nAs ever oak or stone was sound.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA callat\\nOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband\\nAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\\nIt is the issue of Polixenes:\\nHence with it, and together with the dam\\nCommit them to the fire!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nIt is yours;\\nAnd, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,\\nSo like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\\nAlthough the print be little, the whole matter\\nAnd copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,\\nThe trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,\\nThe pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,\\nHis smiles,\\nThe very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\\nAnd thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\\nSo like to him that got it, if thou hast\\nThe ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours\\nNo yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,\\nHer children not her husband's!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA gross hag\\nAnd, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,\\nThat wilt not stay her tongue.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nHang all the husbands\\nThat cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself\\nHardly one subject.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOnce more, take her hence.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nA most unworthy and unnatural lord\\nCan do no more.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI'll ha' thee burnt.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI care not:\\nIt is an heretic that makes the fire,\\nNot she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;\\nBut this most cruel usage of your queen,\\nNot able to produce more accusation\\nThan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours\\nOf tyranny and will ignoble make you,\\nYea, scandalous to the world.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOn your allegiance,\\nOut of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\\nWhere were her life? she durst not call me so,\\nIf she did know me one. Away with her!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.\\nLook to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:\\nJove send her\\nA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\\nYou, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,\\nWill never do him good, not one of you.\\nSo, so: farewell; we are gone.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\\nMy child? away with't! Even thou, that hast\\nA heart so tender o'er it, take it hence\\nAnd see it instantly consumed with fire;\\nEven thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:\\nWithin this hour bring me word 'tis done,\\nAnd by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,\\nWith what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse\\nAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\\nThe bastard brains with these my proper hands\\nShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\\nFor thou set'st on thy wife.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI did not, sir:\\nThese lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\\nCan clear me in't.\\n\\nLords:\\nWe can: my royal liege,\\nHe is not guilty of her coming hither.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou're liars all.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBeseech your highness, give us better credit:\\nWe have always truly served you, and beseech you\\nSo to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,\\nAs recompense of our dear services\\nPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,\\nWhich being so horrible, so bloody, must\\nLead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI am a feather for each wind that blows:\\nShall I live on to see this bastard kneel\\nAnd call me father? better burn it now\\nThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.\\nIt shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;\\nYou that have been so tenderly officious\\nWith Lady Margery, your midwife there,\\nTo save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,\\nSo sure as this beard's grey,\\n--what will you adventure\\nTo save this brat's life?\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nAny thing, my lord,\\nThat my ability may undergo\\nAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:\\nI'll pawn the little blood which I have left\\nTo save the innocent: any thing possible.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIt shall be possible. Swear by this sword\\nThou wilt perform my bidding.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI will, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail\\nOf any point in't shall not only be\\nDeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,\\nWhom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\\nAs thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry\\nThis female bastard hence and that thou bear it\\nTo some remote and desert place quite out\\nOf our dominions, and that there thou leave it,\\nWithout more mercy, to its own protection\\nAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\\nIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\\nOn thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,\\nThat thou commend it strangely to some place\\nWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI swear to do this, though a present death\\nHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:\\nSome powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens\\nTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say\\nCasting their savageness aside have done\\nLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous\\nIn more than this deed does require! And blessing\\nAgainst this cruelty fight on thy side,\\nPoor thing, condemn'd to loss!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, I'll not rear\\nAnother's issue.\\n\\nServant:\\nPlease your highness, posts\\nFrom those you sent to the oracle are come\\nAn hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,\\nBeing well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,\\nHasting to the court.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nSo please you, sir, their speed\\nHath been beyond account.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTwenty-three days\\nThey have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells\\nThe great Apollo suddenly will have\\nThe truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;\\nSummon a session, that we may arraign\\nOur most disloyal lady, for, as she hath\\nBeen publicly accused, so shall she have\\nA just and open trial. While she lives\\nMy heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,\\nAnd think upon my bidding.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nThe climate's delicate, the air most sweet,\\nFertile the isle, the temple much surpassing\\nThe common praise it bears.\\n\\nDION:\\nI shall report,\\nFor most it caught me, the celestial habits,\\nMethinks I so should term them, and the reverence\\nOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!\\nHow ceremonious, solemn and unearthly\\nIt was i' the offering!\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nBut of all, the burst\\nAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,\\nKin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.\\nThat I was nothing.\\n\\nDION:\\nIf the event o' the journey\\nProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--\\nAs it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,\\nThe time is worth the use on't.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nGreat Apollo\\nTurn all to the best! These proclamations,\\nSo forcing faults upon Hermione,\\nI little like.\\n\\nDION:\\nThe violent carriage of it\\nWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,\\nThus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,\\nShall the contents discover, something rare\\nEven then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!\\nAnd gracious be the issue!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThis sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,\\nEven pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried\\nThe daughter of a king, our wife, and one\\nOf us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd\\nOf being tyrannous, since we so openly\\nProceed in justice, which shall have due course,\\nEven to the guilt or the purgation.\\nProduce the prisoner.\\n\\nOfficer:\\nIt is his highness' pleasure that the queen\\nAppear in person here in court. Silence!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nRead the indictment.\\n\\nOfficer:\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSince what I am to say must be but that\\nWhich contradicts my accusation and\\nThe testimony on my part no other\\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\\nTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\\nBe so received. But thus: if powers divine\\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\\nI doubt not then but innocence shall make\\nFalse accusation blush and tyranny\\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\\nThan history can pattern, though devised\\nAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold me\\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\\nA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\\nTo prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\\n'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\\nHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\\nThat way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\\nOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\\nCry fie upon my grave!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI ne'er heard yet\\nThat any of these bolder vices wanted\\nLess impudence to gainsay what they did\\nThan to perform it first.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThat's true enough;\\nThrough 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou will not own it.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nMore than mistress of\\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\\nWith whom I am accused, I do confess\\nI loved him as in honour he required,\\nWith such a kind of love as might become\\nA lady like me, with a love even such,\\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\\nWhich not to have done I think had been in me\\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\\nEven since it could speak, from an infant, freely\\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\\nI know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou knew of his departure, as you know\\nWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSir,\\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\\nWhich I'll lay down.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYour actions are my dreams;\\nYou had a bastard by Polixenes,\\nAnd I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--\\nThose of your fact are so--so past all truth:\\nWhich to deny concerns more than avails; for as\\nThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\\nNo father owning it,--which is, indeed,\\nMore criminal in thee than it,--so thou\\nShalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage\\nLook for no less than death.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSir, spare your threats:\\nThe bug which you would fright me with I seek.\\nTo me can life be no commodity:\\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\\nI do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\\nBut know not how it went. My second joy\\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\\nI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\\nStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\\nThe innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\\nHaled out to murder: myself on every post\\nProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\\nHere to this place, i' the open air, before\\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\\nThat I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\\n'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,\\nI do refer me to the oracle:\\nApollo be my judge!\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nThis your request\\nIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,\\nAnd in Apollos name, his oracle.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father:\\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\\nHis daughter's trial! that he did but see\\nThe flatness of my misery, yet with eyes\\nOf pity, not revenge!\\n\\nOfficer:\\nYou here shall swear upon this sword of justice,\\nThat you, Cleomenes and Dion, have\\nBeen both at Delphos, and from thence have brought\\nThe seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd\\nOf great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,\\nYou have not dared to break the holy seal\\nNor read the secrets in't.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nAll this we swear.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nBreak up the seals and read.\\n\\nOfficer:\\n\\nLords:\\nNow blessed be the great Apollo!\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nPraised!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHast thou read truth?\\n\\nOfficer:\\nAy, my lord; even so\\nAs it is here set down.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThere is no truth at all i' the oracle:\\nThe sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.\\n\\nServant:\\nMy lord the king, the king!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat is the business?\\n\\nServant:\\nO sir, I shall be hated to report it!\\nThe prince your son, with mere conceit and fear\\nOf the queen's speed, is gone.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow! gone!\\n\\nServant:\\nIs dead.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nApollo's angry; and the heavens themselves\\nDo strike at my injustice.\\nHow now there!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThis news is mortal to the queen: look down\\nAnd see what death is doing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTake her hence:\\nHer heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:\\nI have too much believed mine own suspicion:\\nBeseech you, tenderly apply to her\\nSome remedies for life.\\nApollo, pardon\\nMy great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!\\nI'll reconcile me to Polixenes,\\nNew woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,\\nWhom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;\\nFor, being transported by my jealousies\\nTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose\\nCamillo for the minister to poison\\nMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,\\nBut that the good mind of Camillo tardied\\nMy swift command, though I with death and with\\nReward did threaten and encourage him,\\nNot doing 't and being done: he, most humane\\nAnd fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest\\nUnclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,\\nWhich you knew great, and to the hazard\\nOf all encertainties himself commended,\\nNo richer than his honour: how he glisters\\nThorough my rust! and how his pity\\nDoes my deeds make the blacker!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWoe the while!\\nO, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\\nBreak too.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nWhat fit is this, good lady?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWhat studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\\nWhat wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?\\nIn leads or oils? what old or newer torture\\nMust I receive, whose every word deserves\\nTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny\\nTogether working with thy jealousies,\\nFancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\\nFor girls of nine, O, think what they have done\\nAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\\nThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\\nThat thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;\\nThat did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\\nAnd damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,\\nThou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,\\nTo have him kill a king: poor trespasses,\\nMore monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\\nThe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter\\nTo be or none or little; though a devil\\nWould have shed water out of fire ere done't:\\nNor is't directly laid to thee, the death\\nOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\\nThoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\\nThat could conceive a gross and foolish sire\\nBlemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,\\nLaid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,\\nWhen I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,\\nThe sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,\\nand vengeance for't\\nNot dropp'd down yet.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nThe higher powers forbid!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath\\nPrevail not, go and see: if you can bring\\nTincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,\\nHeat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you\\nAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\\nDo not repent these things, for they are heavier\\nThan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee\\nTo nothing but despair. A thousand knees\\nTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,\\nUpon a barren mountain and still winter\\nIn storm perpetual, could not move the gods\\nTo look that way thou wert.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo on, go on\\nThou canst not speak too much; I have deserved\\nAll tongues to talk their bitterest.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nSay no more:\\nHowe'er the business goes, you have made fault\\nI' the boldness of your speech.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI am sorry for't:\\nAll faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\\nI do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much\\nThe rashness of a woman: he is touch'd\\nTo the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help\\nShould be past grief: do not receive affliction\\nAt my petition; I beseech you, rather\\nLet me be punish'd, that have minded you\\nOf what you should forget. Now, good my liege\\nSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:\\nThe love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--\\nI'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;\\nI'll not remember you of my own lord,\\nWho is lost too: take your patience to you,\\nAnd I'll say nothing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou didst speak but well\\nWhen most the truth; which I receive much better\\nThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me\\nTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:\\nOne grave shall be for both: upon them shall\\nThe causes of their death appear, unto\\nOur shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit\\nThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\\nShall be my recreation: so long as nature\\nWill bear up with this exercise, so long\\nI daily vow to use it. Come and lead me\\nUnto these sorrows.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nThou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon\\nThe deserts of Bohemia?\\n\\nMariner:\\nAy, my lord: and fear\\nWe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly\\nAnd threaten present blusters. In my conscience,\\nThe heavens with that we have in hand are angry\\nAnd frown upon 's.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nTheir sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;\\nLook to thy bark: I'll not be long before\\nI call upon thee.\\n\\nMariner:\\nMake your best haste, and go not\\nToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;\\nBesides, this place is famous for the creatures\\nOf prey that keep upon't.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nGo thou away:\\nI'll follow instantly.\\n\\nMariner:\\nI am glad at heart\\nTo be so rid o' the business.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nCome, poor babe:\\nI have heard, but not believed,\\nthe spirits o' the dead\\nMay walk again: if such thing be, thy mother\\nAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream\\nSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,\\nSometimes her head on one side, some another;\\nI never saw a vessel of like sorrow,\\nSo fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,\\nLike very sanctity, she did approach\\nMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,\\nAnd gasping to begin some speech, her eyes\\nBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anon\\nDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,\\nSince fate, against thy better disposition,\\nHath made thy person for the thrower-out\\nOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,\\nPlaces remote enough are in Bohemia,\\nThere weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe\\nIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,\\nI prithee, call't. For this ungentle business\\nPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see\\nThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks\\nShe melted into air. Affrighted much,\\nI did in time collect myself and thought\\nThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:\\nYet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\\nI will be squared by this. I do believe\\nHermione hath suffer'd death, and that\\nApollo would, this being indeed the issue\\nOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\\nEither for life or death, upon the earth\\nOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!\\nThere lie, and there thy character: there these;\\nWhich may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\\nAnd still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,\\nThat for thy mother's fault art thus exposed\\nTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\\nBut my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I\\nTo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!\\nThe day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have\\nA lullaby too rough: I never saw\\nThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\\nWell may I get aboard! This is the chase:\\nI am gone for ever.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI would there were no age between sixteen and\\nthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the\\nrest; for there is nothing in the between but\\ngetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,\\nstealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but\\nthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty\\nhunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\\nbest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find\\nthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by\\nthe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy\\nwill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very\\npretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A\\npretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:\\nthough I am not bookish, yet I can read\\nwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been\\nsome stair-work, some trunk-work, some\\nbehind-door-work: they were warmer that got this\\nthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for\\npity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed\\nbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!\\n\\nClown:\\nHilloa, loa!\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhat, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk\\non when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What\\nailest thou, man?\\n\\nClown:\\nI have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!\\nbut I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the\\nsky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust\\na bodkin's point.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhy, boy, how is it?\\n\\nClown:\\nI would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,\\nhow it takes up the shore! but that's not the\\npoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!\\nsometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the\\nship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon\\nswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a\\ncork into a hogshead. And then for the\\nland-service, to see how the bear tore out his\\nshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said\\nhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an\\nend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned\\nit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the\\nsea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared\\nand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than\\nthe sea or weather.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nName of mercy, when was this, boy?\\n\\nClown:\\nNow, now: I have not winked since I saw these\\nsights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor\\nthe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it\\nnow.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWould I had been by, to have helped the old man!\\n\\nClown:\\nI would you had been by the ship side, to have\\nhelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nHeavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,\\nboy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things\\ndying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for\\nthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's\\nchild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;\\nopen't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be\\nrich by the fairies. This is some changeling:\\nopen't. What's within, boy?\\n\\nClown:\\nYou're a made old man: if the sins of your youth\\nare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThis is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up\\nwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.\\nWe are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires\\nnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good\\nboy, the next way home.\\n\\nClown:\\nGo you the next way with your findings. I'll go see\\nif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much\\nhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when they\\nare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury\\nit.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThat's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that\\nwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to the\\nsight of him.\\n\\nClown:\\nMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.\\n\\nShepherd:\\n'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.\\n\\nTime:\\nI, that please some, try all, both joy and terror\\nOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\\nNow take upon me, in the name of Time,\\nTo use my wings. Impute it not a crime\\nTo me or my swift passage, that I slide\\nO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried\\nOf that wide gap, since it is in my power\\nTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour\\nTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass\\nThe same I am, ere ancient'st order was\\nOr what is now received: I witness to\\nThe times that brought them in; so shall I do\\nTo the freshest things now reigning and make stale\\nThe glistering of this present, as my tale\\nNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\\nI turn my glass and give my scene such growing\\nAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,\\nThe effects of his fond jealousies so grieving\\nThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,\\nGentle spectators, that I now may be\\nIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,\\nI mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel\\nI now name to you; and with speed so pace\\nTo speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\\nEqual with wondering: what of her ensues\\nI list not prophecy; but let Time's news\\nBe known when 'tis brought forth.\\nA shepherd's daughter,\\nAnd what to her adheres, which follows after,\\nIs the argument of Time. Of this allow,\\nIf ever you have spent time worse ere now;\\nIf never, yet that Time himself doth say\\nHe wishes earnestly you never may.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:\\n'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to\\ngrant this.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nIt is fifteen years since I saw my country: though\\nI have for the most part been aired abroad, I\\ndesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent\\nking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling\\nsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to\\nthink so, which is another spur to my departure.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAs thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of\\nthy services by leaving me now: the need I have of\\nthee thine own goodness hath made; better not to\\nhave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having\\nmade me businesses which none without thee can\\nsufficiently manage, must either stay to execute\\nthem thyself or take away with thee the very\\nservices thou hast done; which if I have not enough\\nconsidered, as too much I cannot, to be more\\nthankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit\\ntherein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal\\ncountry, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very\\nnaming punishes me with the remembrance of that\\npenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,\\nmy brother; whose loss of his most precious queen\\nand children are even now to be afresh lamented.\\nSay to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my\\nson? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not\\nbeing gracious, than they are in losing them when\\nthey have approved their virtues.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What\\nhis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I\\nhave missingly noted, he is of late much retired\\nfrom court and is less frequent to his princely\\nexercises than formerly he hath appeared.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI have considered so much, Camillo, and with some\\ncare; so far that I have eyes under my service which\\nlook upon his removedness; from whom I have this\\nintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a\\nmost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from\\nvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of his\\nneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\\ndaughter of most rare note: the report of her is\\nextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThat's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I\\nfear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou\\nshalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not\\nappearing what we are, have some question with the\\nshepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not\\nuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.\\nPrithee, be my present partner in this business, and\\nlay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI willingly obey your command.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMy best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhen daffodils begin to peer,\\nWith heigh! the doxy over the dale,\\nWhy, then comes in the sweet o' the year;\\nFor the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.\\nThe white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\\nWith heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\\nDoth set my pugging tooth on edge;\\nFor a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\\nThe lark, that tirra-lyra chants,\\nWith heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,\\nAre summer songs for me and my aunts,\\nWhile we lie tumbling in the hay.\\nI have served Prince Florizel and in my time\\nwore three-pile; but now I am out of service:\\nBut shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\\nThe pale moon shines by night:\\nAnd when I wander here and there,\\nI then do most go right.\\nIf tinkers may have leave to live,\\nAnd bear the sow-skin budget,\\nThen my account I well may, give,\\nAnd in the stocks avouch it.\\nMy traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to\\nlesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who\\nbeing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise\\na snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and\\ndrab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is\\nthe silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful\\non the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to\\nme: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought\\nof it. A prize! a prize!\\n\\nClown:\\nLet me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod\\nyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred\\nshorn. what comes the wool to?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nI cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am\\nI to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound\\nof sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will\\nthis sister of mine do with rice? But my father\\nhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it\\non. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for\\nthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good\\nones; but they are most of them means and bases; but\\none puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to\\nhorn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden\\npies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;\\nnutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I\\nmay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of\\nraisins o' the sun.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO that ever I was born!\\n\\nClown:\\nI' the name of me--\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and\\nthen, death, death!\\n\\nClown:\\nAlack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay\\non thee, rather than have these off.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more\\nthan the stripes I have received, which are mighty\\nones and millions.\\n\\nClown:\\nAlas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a\\ngreat matter.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel\\nta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon\\nme.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat, by a horseman, or a footman?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA footman, sweet sir, a footman.\\n\\nClown:\\nIndeed, he should be a footman by the garments he\\nhas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,\\nit hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,\\nI'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, good sir, tenderly, O!\\n\\nClown:\\nAlas, poor soul!\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my\\nshoulder-blade is out.\\n\\nClown:\\nHow now! canst stand?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nDost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNo, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have\\na kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,\\nunto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or\\nany thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;\\nthat kills my heart.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat manner of fellow was he that robbed you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with\\ntroll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the\\nprince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his\\nvirtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.\\n\\nClown:\\nHis vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped\\nout of the court: they cherish it to make it stay\\nthere; and yet it will no more but abide.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he\\nhath been since an ape-bearer; then a\\nprocess-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a\\nmotion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's\\nwife within a mile where my land and living lies;\\nand, having flown over many knavish professions, he\\nsettled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.\\n\\nClown:\\nOut upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts\\nwakes, fairs and bear-baitings.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVery true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that\\nput me into this apparel.\\n\\nClown:\\nNot a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had\\nbut looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am\\nfalse of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant\\nhim.\\n\\nClown:\\nHow do you now?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nSweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and\\nwalk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace\\nsoftly towards my kinsman's.\\n\\nClown:\\nShall I bring thee on the way?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNo, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.\\n\\nClown:\\nThen fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our\\nsheep-shearing.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nProsper you, sweet sir!\\nYour purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.\\nI'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I\\nmake not this cheat bring out another and the\\nshearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name\\nput in the book of virtue!\\nJog on, jog on, the foot-path way,\\nAnd merrily hent the stile-a:\\nA merry heart goes all the day,\\nYour sad tires in a mile-a.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nThese your unusual weeds to each part of you\\nDo give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora\\nPeering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing\\nIs as a meeting of the petty gods,\\nAnd you the queen on't.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSir, my gracious lord,\\nTo chide at your extremes it not becomes me:\\nO, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,\\nThe gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured\\nWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\\nMost goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts\\nIn every mess have folly and the feeders\\nDigest it with a custom, I should blush\\nTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,\\nTo show myself a glass.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI bless the time\\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\\nThy father's ground.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nNow Jove afford you cause!\\nTo me the difference forges dread; your greatness\\nHath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble\\nTo think your father, by some accident,\\nShould pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!\\nHow would he look, to see his work so noble\\nVilely bound up? What would he say? Or how\\nShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold\\nThe sternness of his presence?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nApprehend\\nNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\\nHumbling their deities to love, have taken\\nThe shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter\\nBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune\\nA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,\\nGolden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\\nAs I seem now. Their transformations\\nWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,\\nNor in a way so chaste, since my desires\\nRun not before mine honour, nor my lusts\\nBurn hotter than my faith.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO, but, sir,\\nYour resolution cannot hold, when 'tis\\nOpposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:\\nOne of these two must be necessities,\\nWhich then will speak, that you must\\nchange this purpose,\\nOr I my life.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nThou dearest Perdita,\\nWith these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not\\nThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,\\nOr not my father's. For I cannot be\\nMine own, nor any thing to any, if\\nI be not thine. To this I am most constant,\\nThough destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;\\nStrangle such thoughts as these with any thing\\nThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\\nLift up your countenance, as it were the day\\nOf celebration of that nuptial which\\nWe two have sworn shall come.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO lady Fortune,\\nStand you auspicious!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nSee, your guests approach:\\nAddress yourself to entertain them sprightly,\\nAnd let's be red with mirth.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nFie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon\\nThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,\\nBoth dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;\\nWould sing her song and dance her turn; now here,\\nAt upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;\\nOn his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire\\nWith labour and the thing she took to quench it,\\nShe would to each one sip. You are retired,\\nAs if you were a feasted one and not\\nThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid\\nThese unknown friends to's welcome; for it is\\nA way to make us better friends, more known.\\nCome, quench your blushes and present yourself\\nThat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,\\nAnd bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,\\nAs your good flock shall prosper.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShepherdess,\\nA fair one are you--well you fit our ages\\nWith flowers of winter.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSir, the year growing ancient,\\nNot yet on summer's death, nor on the birth\\nOf trembling winter, the fairest\\nflowers o' the season\\nAre our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,\\nWhich some call nature's bastards: of that kind\\nOur rustic garden's barren; and I care not\\nTo get slips of them.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWherefore, gentle maiden,\\nDo you neglect them?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nFor I have heard it said\\nThere is an art which in their piedness shares\\nWith great creating nature.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nSay there be;\\nYet nature is made better by no mean\\nBut nature makes that mean: so, over that art\\nWhich you say adds to nature, is an art\\nThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\\nA gentler scion to the wildest stock,\\nAnd make conceive a bark of baser kind\\nBy bud of nobler race: this is an art\\nWhich does mend nature, change it rather, but\\nThe art itself is nature.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSo it is.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThen make your garden rich in gillyvors,\\nAnd do not call them bastards.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI'll not put\\nThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;\\nNo more than were I painted I would wish\\nThis youth should say 'twere well and only therefore\\nDesire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;\\nHot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;\\nThe marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun\\nAnd with him rises weeping: these are flowers\\nOf middle summer, and I think they are given\\nTo men of middle age. You're very welcome.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\\nAnd only live by gazing.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nOut, alas!\\nYou'd be so lean, that blasts of January\\nWould blow you through and through.\\nNow, my fair'st friend,\\nI would I had some flowers o' the spring that might\\nBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,\\nThat wear upon your virgin branches yet\\nYour maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,\\nFor the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall\\nFrom Dis's waggon! daffodils,\\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\\nThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\\nOr Cytherea's breath; pale primroses\\nThat die unmarried, ere they can behold\\nBight Phoebus in his strength--a malady\\nMost incident to maids; bold oxlips and\\nThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\\nThe flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,\\nTo make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,\\nTo strew him o'er and o'er!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhat, like a corse?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nNo, like a bank for love to lie and play on;\\nNot like a corse; or if, not to be buried,\\nBut quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:\\nMethinks I play as I have seen them do\\nIn Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine\\nDoes change my disposition.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhat you do\\nStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.\\nI'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,\\nI'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\\nPray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,\\nTo sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you\\nA wave o' the sea, that you might ever do\\nNothing but that; move still, still so,\\nAnd own no other function: each your doing,\\nSo singular in each particular,\\nCrowns what you are doing in the present deed,\\nThat all your acts are queens.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO Doricles,\\nYour praises are too large: but that your youth,\\nAnd the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,\\nDo plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,\\nWith wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,\\nYou woo'd me the false way.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI think you have\\nAs little skill to fear as I have purpose\\nTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:\\nYour hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,\\nThat never mean to part.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI'll swear for 'em.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\\nRan on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems\\nBut smacks of something greater than herself,\\nToo noble for this place.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe tells her something\\nThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is\\nThe queen of curds and cream.\\n\\nClown:\\nCome on, strike up!\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nMopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,\\nTo mend her kissing with!\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nNow, in good time!\\n\\nClown:\\nNot a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.\\nCome, strike up!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nPray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this\\nWhich dances with your daughter?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThey call him Doricles; and boasts himself\\nTo have a worthy feeding: but I have it\\nUpon his own report and I believe it;\\nHe looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:\\nI think so too; for never gazed the moon\\nUpon the water as he'll stand and read\\nAs 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.\\nI think there is not half a kiss to choose\\nWho loves another best.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShe dances featly.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nSo she does any thing; though I report it,\\nThat should be silent: if young Doricles\\nDo light upon her, she shall bring him that\\nWhich he not dreams of.\\n\\nServant:\\nO master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the\\ndoor, you would never dance again after a tabour and\\npipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings\\nseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; he\\nutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's\\nears grew to his tunes.\\n\\nClown:\\nHe could never come better; he shall come in. I\\nlove a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful\\nmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing\\nindeed and sung lamentably.\\n\\nServant:\\nHe hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no\\nmilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he\\nhas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without\\nbawdry, which is strange; with such delicate\\nburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump\\nher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,\\nas it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into\\nthe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me\\nno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with\\n'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is a brave fellow.\\n\\nClown:\\nBelieve me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited\\nfellow. Has he any unbraided wares?\\n\\nServant:\\nHe hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;\\npoints more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can\\nlearnedly handle, though they come to him by the\\ngross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he\\nsings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you\\nwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants\\nto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.\\n\\nClown:\\nPrithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nForewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.\\n\\nClown:\\nYou have of these pedlars, that have more in them\\nthan you'ld think, sister.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nAy, good brother, or go about to think.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nLawn as white as driven snow;\\nCyprus black as e'er was crow;\\nGloves as sweet as damask roses;\\nMasks for faces and for noses;\\nBugle bracelet, necklace amber,\\nPerfume for a lady's chamber;\\nGolden quoifs and stomachers,\\nFor my lads to give their dears:\\nPins and poking-sticks of steel,\\nWhat maids lack from head to heel:\\nCome buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;\\nBuy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.\\n\\nClown:\\nIf I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take\\nno money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it\\nwill also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nI was promised them against the feast; but they come\\nnot too late now.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nHe hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nHe hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has\\npaid you more, which will shame you to give him again.\\n\\nClown:\\nIs there no manners left among maids? will they\\nwear their plackets where they should bear their\\nfaces? Is there not milking-time, when you are\\ngoing to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these\\nsecrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all\\nour guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour\\nyour tongues, and not a word more.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nI have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace\\nand a pair of sweet gloves.\\n\\nClown:\\nHave I not told thee how I was cozened by the way\\nand lost all my money?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAnd indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;\\ntherefore it behoves men to be wary.\\n\\nClown:\\nFear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat hast here? ballads?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nPray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'\\nlife, for then we are sure they are true.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's\\nwife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a\\nburthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and\\ntoads carbonadoed.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nIs it true, think you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVery true, and but a month old.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nBless me from marrying a usurer!\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress\\nTale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were\\npresent. Why should I carry lies abroad?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nPray you now, buy it.\\n\\nClown:\\nCome on, lay it by: and let's first see moe\\nballads; we'll buy the other things anon.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon\\nthe coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,\\nforty thousand fathom above water, and sung this\\nballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was\\nthought she was a woman and was turned into a cold\\nfish for she would not exchange flesh with one that\\nloved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nIs it true too, think you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nFive justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than\\nmy pack will hold.\\n\\nClown:\\nLay it by too: another.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nThis is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nLet's have some merry ones.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhy, this is a passing merry one and goes to\\nthe tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's\\nscarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in\\nrequest, I can tell you.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nWe can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou\\nshalt hear; 'tis in three parts.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWe had the tune on't a month ago.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI can bear my part; you must know 'tis my\\noccupation; have at it with you.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nGet you hence, for I must go\\nWhere it fits not you to know.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhither?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nO, whither?\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhither?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nIt becomes thy oath full well,\\nThou to me thy secrets tell.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nMe too, let me go thither.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nOr thou goest to the orange or mill.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nIf to either, thou dost ill.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNeither.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhat, neither?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNeither.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nThou hast sworn my love to be.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nThou hast sworn it more to me:\\nThen whither goest? say, whither?\\n\\nClown:\\nWe'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my\\nfather and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll\\nnot trouble them.

'Tis time to part them.\\nHe's simple and tells much.\\nHow now, fair shepherd!\\nYour heart is full of something that does take\\nYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young\\nAnd handed love as you do, I was wont\\nTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd\\nThe pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it\\nTo her acceptance; you have let him go\\nAnd nothing marted with him. If your lass\\nInterpretation should abuse and call this\\nYour lack of love or bounty, you were straited\\nFor a reply, at least if you make a care\\nOf happy holding her.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nOld sir, I know\\nShe prizes not such trifles as these are:\\nThe gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd\\nUp in my heart; which I have given already,\\nBut not deliver'd.

I take thy hand, this hand,\\nAs soft as dove's down and as white as it,\\nOr Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd\\nsnow that's bolted\\nBy the northern blasts twice o'er.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat follows this?\\nHow prettily the young swain seems to wash\\nThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:\\nBut to your protestation; let me hear\\nWhat you profess.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nDo, and be witness to 't.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAnd this my neighbour too?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nAnd he, and more\\nThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\\nThat, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,\\nThereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\\nThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\\nMore than was ever man's, I would not prize them\\nWithout her love; for her employ them all;\\nCommend them and condemn them to her service\\nOr to their own perdition.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nFairly offer'd.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThis shows a sound affection.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nBut, my daughter,\\nSay you the like to him?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI cannot speak\\nSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\\nBy the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\\nThe purity of his.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nTake hands, a bargain!\\nAnd, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:\\nI give my daughter to him, and will make\\nHer portion equal his.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nO, that must be\\nI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\\nI shall have more than you can dream of yet;\\nEnough then for your wonder. But, come on,\\nContract us 'fore these witnesses.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nCome, your hand;\\nAnd, daughter, yours.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\\nHave you a father?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI have: but what of him?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nKnows he of this?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHe neither does nor shall.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMethinks a father\\nIs at the nuptial of his son a guest\\nThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\\nIs not your father grown incapable\\nOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\\nWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?\\nKnow man from man? dispute his own estate?\\nLies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\\nBut what he did being childish?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNo, good sir;\\nHe has his health and ampler strength indeed\\nThan most have of his age.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nBy my white beard,\\nYou offer him, if this be so, a wrong\\nSomething unfilial: reason my son\\nShould choose himself a wife, but as good reason\\nThe father, all whose joy is nothing else\\nBut fair posterity, should hold some counsel\\nIn such a business.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI yield all this;\\nBut for some other reasons, my grave sir,\\nWhich 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint\\nMy father of this business.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nLet him know't.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHe shall not.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nPrithee, let him.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNo, he must not.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nLet him, my son: he shall not need to grieve\\nAt knowing of thy choice.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nCome, come, he must not.\\nMark our contract.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMark your divorce, young sir,\\nWhom son I dare not call; thou art too base\\nTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,\\nThat thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,\\nI am sorry that by hanging thee I can\\nBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece\\nOf excellent witchcraft, who of force must know\\nThe royal fool thou copest with,--\\n\\nShepherd:\\nO, my heart!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made\\nMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,\\nIf I may ever know thou dost but sigh\\nThat thou no more shalt see this knack, as never\\nI mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;\\nNot hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,\\nFar than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:\\nFollow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,\\nThough full of our displeasure, yet we free thee\\nFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--\\nWorthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,\\nThat makes himself, but for our honour therein,\\nUnworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou\\nThese rural latches to his entrance open,\\nOr hoop his body more with thy embraces,\\nI will devise a death as cruel for thee\\nAs thou art tender to't.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nEven here undone!\\nI was not much afeard; for once or twice\\nI was about to speak and tell him plainly,\\nThe selfsame sun that shines upon his court\\nHides not his visage from our cottage but\\nLooks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?\\nI told you what would come of this: beseech you,\\nOf your own state take care: this dream of mine,--\\nBeing now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,\\nBut milk my ewes and weep.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWhy, how now, father!\\nSpeak ere thou diest.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI cannot speak, nor think\\nNor dare to know that which I know. O sir!\\nYou have undone a man of fourscore three,\\nThat thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,\\nTo die upon the bed my father died,\\nTo lie close by his honest bones: but now\\nSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay me\\nWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,\\nThat knew'st this was the prince,\\nand wouldst adventure\\nTo mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!\\nIf I might die within this hour, I have lived\\nTo die when I desire.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhy look you so upon me?\\nI am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,\\nBut nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;\\nMore straining on for plucking back, not following\\nMy leash unwillingly.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nGracious my lord,\\nYou know your father's temper: at this time\\nHe will allow no speech, which I do guess\\nYou do not purpose to him; and as hardly\\nWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\\nThen, till the fury of his highness settle,\\nCome not before him.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI not purpose it.\\nI think, Camillo?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nEven he, my lord.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nHow often have I told you 'twould be thus!\\nHow often said, my dignity would last\\nBut till 'twere known!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nIt cannot fail but by\\nThe violation of my faith; and then\\nLet nature crush the sides o' the earth together\\nAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:\\nFrom my succession wipe me, father; I\\nAm heir to my affection.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBe advised.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI am, and by my fancy: if my reason\\nWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;\\nIf not, my senses, better pleased with madness,\\nDo bid it welcome.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThis is desperate, sir.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nSo call it: but it does fulfil my vow;\\nI needs must think it honesty. Camillo,\\nNot for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may\\nBe thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or\\nThe close earth wombs or the profound sea hides\\nIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oath\\nTo this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,\\nAs you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,\\nWhen he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not\\nTo see him any more,--cast your good counsels\\nUpon his passion; let myself and fortune\\nTug for the time to come. This you may know\\nAnd so deliver, I am put to sea\\nWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;\\nAnd most opportune to our need I have\\nA vessel rides fast by, but not prepared\\nFor this design. What course I mean to hold\\nShall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor\\nConcern me the reporting.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nO my lord!\\nI would your spirit were easier for advice,\\nOr stronger for your need.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHark, Perdita\\nI'll hear you by and by.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe's irremoveable,\\nResolved for flight. Now were I happy, if\\nHis going I could frame to serve my turn,\\nSave him from danger, do him love and honour,\\nPurchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\\nAnd that unhappy king, my master, whom\\nI so much thirst to see.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNow, good Camillo;\\nI am so fraught with curious business that\\nI leave out ceremony.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, I think\\nYou have heard of my poor services, i' the love\\nThat I have borne your father?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nVery nobly\\nHave you deserved: it is my father's music\\nTo speak your deeds, not little of his care\\nTo have them recompensed as thought on.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWell, my lord,\\nIf you may please to think I love the king\\nAnd through him what is nearest to him, which is\\nYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:\\nIf your more ponderous and settled project\\nMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,\\nI'll point you where you shall have such receiving\\nAs shall become your highness; where you may\\nEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,\\nThere's no disjunction to be made, but by--\\nAs heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,\\nAnd, with my best endeavours in your absence,\\nYour discontenting father strive to qualify\\nAnd bring him up to liking.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHow, Camillo,\\nMay this, almost a miracle, be done?\\nThat I may call thee something more than man\\nAnd after that trust to thee.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHave you thought on\\nA place whereto you'll go?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNot any yet:\\nBut as the unthought-on accident is guilty\\nTo what we wildly do, so we profess\\nOurselves to be the slaves of chance and flies\\nOf every wind that blows.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThen list to me:\\nThis follows, if you will not change your purpose\\nBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\\nAnd there present yourself and your fair princess,\\nFor so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:\\nShe shall be habited as it becomes\\nThe partner of your bed. Methinks I see\\nLeontes opening his free arms and weeping\\nHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,\\nAs 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands\\nOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him\\n'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one\\nHe chides to hell and bids the other grow\\nFaster than thought or time.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWorthy Camillo,\\nWhat colour for my visitation shall I\\nHold up before him?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSent by the king your father\\nTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\\nThe manner of your bearing towards him, with\\nWhat you as from your father shall deliver,\\nThings known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:\\nThe which shall point you forth at every sitting\\nWhat you must say; that he shall not perceive\\nBut that you have your father's bosom there\\nAnd speak his very heart.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI am bound to you:\\nThere is some sap in this.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nA cause more promising\\nThan a wild dedication of yourselves\\nTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain\\nTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,\\nBut as you shake off one to take another;\\nNothing so certain as your anchors, who\\nDo their best office, if they can but stay you\\nWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you know\\nProsperity's the very bond of love,\\nWhose fresh complexion and whose heart together\\nAffliction alters.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nOne of these is true:\\nI think affliction may subdue the cheek,\\nBut not take in the mind.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nYea, say you so?\\nThere shall not at your father's house these\\nseven years\\nBe born another such.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nMy good Camillo,\\nShe is as forward of her breeding as\\nShe is i' the rear our birth.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI cannot say 'tis pity\\nShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\\nTo most that teach.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nYour pardon, sir; for this\\nI'll blush you thanks.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nMy prettiest Perdita!\\nBut O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,\\nPreserver of my father, now of me,\\nThe medicine of our house, how shall we do?\\nWe are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,\\nNor shall appear in Sicilia.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy lord,\\nFear none of this: I think you know my fortunes\\nDo all lie there: it shall be so my care\\nTo have you royally appointed as if\\nThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\\nThat you may know you shall not want, one word.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHa, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his\\nsworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold\\nall my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a\\nribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,\\nknife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,\\nto keep my pack from fasting: they throng who\\nshould buy first, as if my trinkets had been\\nhallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:\\nby which means I saw whose purse was best in\\npicture; and what I saw, to my good use I\\nremembered. My clown, who wants but something to\\nbe a reasonable man, grew so in love with the\\nwenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes\\ntill he had both tune and words; which so drew the\\nrest of the herd to me that all their other senses\\nstuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it\\nwas senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a\\npurse; I could have filed keys off that hung in\\nchains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,\\nand admiring the nothing of it. So that in this\\ntime of lethargy I picked and cut most of their\\nfestival purses; and had not the old man come in\\nwith a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's\\nson and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not\\nleft a purse alive in the whole army.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNay, but my letters, by this means being there\\nSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nAnd those that you'll procure from King Leontes--\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nShall satisfy your father.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nHappy be you!\\nAll that you speak shows fair.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWho have we here?\\nWe'll make an instrument of this, omit\\nNothing may give us aid.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIf they have overheard me now, why, hanging.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHow now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear\\nnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWhy, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from\\nthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must\\nmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,\\n--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and\\nchange garments with this gentleman: though the\\npennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,\\nthere's some boot.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI am a poor fellow, sir.\\nI know ye well enough.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half\\nflayed already.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAre you in earnest, sir?\\nI smell the trick on't.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nDispatch, I prithee.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIndeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with\\nconscience take it.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nUnbuckle, unbuckle.\\nFortunate mistress,--let my prophecy\\nCome home to ye!--you must retire yourself\\nInto some covert: take your sweetheart's hat\\nAnd pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,\\nDismantle you, and, as you can, disliken\\nThe truth of your own seeming; that you may--\\nFor I do fear eyes over--to shipboard\\nGet undescried.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI see the play so lies\\nThat I must bear a part.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNo remedy.\\nHave you done there?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nShould I now meet my father,\\nHe would not call me son.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNay, you shall have no hat.\\nCome, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAdieu, sir.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nO Perdita, what have we twain forgot!\\nPray you, a word.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nFortune speed us!\\nThus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThe swifter speed the better.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI understand the business, I hear it: to have an\\nopen ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is\\nnecessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite\\nalso, to smell out work for the other senses. I see\\nthis is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.\\nWhat an exchange had this been without boot! What\\na boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do\\nthis year connive at us, and we may do any thing\\nextempore. The prince himself is about a piece of\\niniquity, stealing away from his father with his\\nclog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of\\nhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not\\ndo't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;\\nand therein am I constant to my profession.\\nAside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:\\nevery lane's end, every shop, church, session,\\nhanging, yields a careful man work.\\n\\nClown:\\nSee, see; what a man you are now!\\nThere is no other way but to tell the king\\nshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nNay, but hear me.\\n\\nClown:\\nNay, but hear me.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nGo to, then.\\n\\nClown:\\nShe being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh\\nand blood has not offended the king; and so your\\nflesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show\\nthose things you found about her, those secret\\nthings, all but what she has with her: this being\\ndone, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his\\nson's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,\\nneither to his father nor to me, to go about to make\\nme the king's brother-in-law.\\n\\nClown:\\nIndeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you\\ncould have been to him and then your blood had been\\nthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWell, let us to the king: there is that in this\\nfardel will make him scratch his beard.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nPray heartily he be at palace.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nShepherd:\\nTo the palace, an it like your worship.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nYour affairs there, what, with whom, the condition\\nof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your\\nnames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any\\nthing that is fitting to be known, discover.\\n\\nClown:\\nWe are but plain fellows, sir.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no\\nlying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they\\noften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for\\nit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore\\nthey do not give us the lie.\\n\\nClown:\\nYour worship had like to have given us one, if you\\nhad not taken yourself with the manner.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAre you a courtier, an't like you, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest\\nthou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?\\nhath not my gait in it the measure of the court?\\nreceives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I\\nnot on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,\\nfor that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy\\nbusiness, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier\\ncap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck\\nback thy business there: whereupon I command thee to\\nopen thy affair.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nMy business, sir, is to the king.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhat advocate hast thou to him?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI know not, an't like you.\\n\\nClown:\\nAdvocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you\\nhave none.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nNone, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHow blessed are we that are not simple men!\\nYet nature might have made me as these are,\\nTherefore I will not disdain.\\n\\nClown:\\nThis cannot be but a great courtier.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nHis garments are rich, but he wears\\nthem not handsomely.\\n\\nClown:\\nHe seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:\\na great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking\\non's teeth.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nThe fardel there? what's i' the fardel?\\nWherefore that box?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nSir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,\\nwhich none must know but the king; and which he\\nshall know within this hour, if I may come to the\\nspeech of him.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAge, thou hast lost thy labour.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhy, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nThe king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a\\nnew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,\\nif thou beest capable of things serious, thou must\\nknow the king is full of grief.\\n\\nShepard:\\nSo 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have\\nmarried a shepherd's daughter.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIf that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:\\nthe curses he shall have, the tortures he shall\\nfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.\\n\\nClown:\\nThink you so, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNot he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy\\nand vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to\\nhim, though removed fifty times, shall all come\\nunder the hangman: which though it be great pity,\\nyet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a\\nram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into\\ngrace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death\\nis too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a\\nsheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.\\n\\nClown:\\nHas the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't\\nlike you, sir?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHe has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then\\n'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a\\nwasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters\\nand a dram dead; then recovered again with\\naqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as\\nhe is, and in the hottest day prognostication\\nproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the\\nsun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he\\nis to behold him with flies blown to death. But what\\ntalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries\\nare to be smiled at, their offences being so\\ncapital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain\\nmen, what you have to the king: being something\\ngently considered, I'll bring you where he is\\naboard, tender your persons to his presence,\\nwhisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man\\nbesides the king to effect your suits, here is man\\nshall do it.\\n\\nClown:\\nHe seems to be of great authority: close with him,\\ngive him gold; and though authority be a stubborn\\nbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show\\nthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,\\nand no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAn't please you, sir, to undertake the business for\\nus, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much\\nmore and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAfter I have done what I promised?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAy, sir.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWell, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?\\n\\nClown:\\nIn some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful\\none, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,\\nhe'll be made an example.\\n\\nClown:\\nComfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show\\nour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your\\ndaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I\\nwill give you as much as this old man does when the\\nbusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, your\\npawn till it be brought you.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;\\ngo on the right hand: I will but look upon the\\nhedge and follow you.\\n\\nClown:\\nWe are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nLet's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nIf I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would\\nnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am\\ncourted now with a double occasion, gold and a means\\nto do the prince my master good; which who knows how\\nthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bring\\nthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he\\nthink it fit to shore them again and that the\\ncomplaint they have to the king concerns him\\nnothing, let him call me rogue for being so far\\nofficious; for I am proof against that title and\\nwhat shame else belongs to't. To him will I present\\nthem: there may be matter in it.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nSir, you have done enough, and have perform'd\\nA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,\\nWhich you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down\\nMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,\\nDo as the heavens have done, forget your evil;\\nWith them forgive yourself.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhilst I remember\\nHer and her virtues, I cannot forget\\nMy blemishes in them, and so still think of\\nThe wrong I did myself; which was so much,\\nThat heirless it hath made my kingdom and\\nDestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man\\nBred his hopes out of.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nTrue, too true, my lord:\\nIf, one by one, you wedded all the world,\\nOr from the all that are took something good,\\nTo make a perfect woman, she you kill'd\\nWould be unparallel'd.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI think so. Kill'd!\\nShe I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me\\nSorely, to say I did; it is as bitter\\nUpon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,\\nSay so but seldom.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nNot at all, good lady:\\nYou might have spoken a thousand things that would\\nHave done the time more benefit and graced\\nYour kindness better.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nYou are one of those\\nWould have him wed again.\\n\\nDION:\\nIf you would not so,\\nYou pity not the state, nor the remembrance\\nOf his most sovereign name; consider little\\nWhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,\\nMay drop upon his kingdom and devour\\nIncertain lookers on. What were more holy\\nThan to rejoice the former queen is well?\\nWhat holier than, for royalty's repair,\\nFor present comfort and for future good,\\nTo bless the bed of majesty again\\nWith a sweet fellow to't?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThere is none worthy,\\nRespecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods\\nWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;\\nFor has not the divine Apollo said,\\nIs't not the tenor of his oracle,\\nThat King Leontes shall not have an heir\\nTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,\\nIs all as monstrous to our human reason\\nAs my Antigonus to break his grave\\nAnd come again to me; who, on my life,\\nDid perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel\\nMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,\\nOppose against their wills.\\nCare not for issue;\\nThe crown will find an heir: great Alexander\\nLeft his to the worthiest; so his successor\\nWas like to be the best.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGood Paulina,\\nWho hast the memory of Hermione,\\nI know, in honour, O, that ever I\\nHad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,\\nI might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,\\nHave taken treasure from her lips--\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nAnd left them\\nMore rich for what they yielded.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou speak'st truth.\\nNo more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,\\nAnd better used, would make her sainted spirit\\nAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,\\nWhere we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,\\nAnd begin, 'Why to me?'\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHad she such power,\\nShe had just cause.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nShe had; and would incense me\\nTo murder her I married.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI should so.\\nWere I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark\\nHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in't\\nYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears\\nShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd\\nShould be 'Remember mine.'\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nStars, stars,\\nAnd all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;\\nI'll have no wife, Paulina.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWill you swear\\nNever to marry but by my free leave?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNever, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThen, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nYou tempt him over-much.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nUnless another,\\nAs like Hermione as is her picture,\\nAffront his eye.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nGood madam,--\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI have done.\\nYet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,\\nNo remedy, but you will,--give me the office\\nTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so young\\nAs was your former; but she shall be such\\nAs, walk'd your first queen's ghost,\\nit should take joy\\nTo see her in your arms.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMy true Paulina,\\nWe shall not marry till thou bid'st us.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThat\\nShall be when your first queen's again in breath;\\nNever till then.\\n\\nGentleman:\\nOne that gives out himself Prince Florizel,\\nSon of Polixenes, with his princess, she\\nThe fairest I have yet beheld, desires access\\nTo your high presence.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat with him? he comes not\\nLike to his father's greatness: his approach,\\nSo out of circumstance and sudden, tells us\\n'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced\\nBy need and accident. What train?\\n\\nGentleman:\\nBut few,\\nAnd those but mean.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHis princess, say you, with him?\\n\\nGentleman:\\nAy, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,\\nThat e'er the sun shone bright on.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nO Hermione,\\nAs every present time doth boast itself\\nAbove a better gone, so must thy grave\\nGive way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself\\nHave said and writ so, but your writing now\\nIs colder than that theme, 'She had not been,\\nNor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse\\nFlow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,\\nTo say you have seen a better.\\n\\nGentleman:\\nPardon, madam:\\nThe one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--\\nThe other, when she has obtain'd your eye,\\nWill have your tongue too. This is a creature,\\nWould she begin a sect, might quench the zeal\\nOf all professors else, make proselytes\\nOf who she but bid follow.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHow! not women?\\n\\nGentleman:\\nWomen will love her, that she is a woman\\nMore worth than any man; men, that she is\\nThe rarest of all women.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo, Cleomenes;\\nYourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,\\nBring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange\\nHe thus should steal upon us.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHad our prince,\\nJewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd\\nWell with this lord: there was not full a month\\nBetween their births.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nPrithee, no more; cease; thou know'st\\nHe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,\\nWhen I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches\\nWill bring me to consider that which may\\nUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.\\nYour mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\\nFor she did print your royal father off,\\nConceiving you: were I but twenty-one,\\nYour father's image is so hit in you,\\nHis very air, that I should call you brother,\\nAs I did him, and speak of something wildly\\nBy us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!\\nAnd your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!\\nI lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth\\nMight thus have stood begetting wonder as\\nYou, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--\\nAll mine own folly--the society,\\nAmity too, of your brave father, whom,\\nThough bearing misery, I desire my life\\nOnce more to look on him.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nBy his command\\nHave I here touch'd Sicilia and from him\\nGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,\\nCan send his brother: and, but infirmity\\nWhich waits upon worn times hath something seized\\nHis wish'd ability, he had himself\\nThe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his\\nMeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--\\nHe bade me say so--more than all the sceptres\\nAnd those that bear them living.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO my brother,\\nGood gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir\\nAfresh within me, and these thy offices,\\nSo rarely kind, are as interpreters\\nOf my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,\\nAs is the spring to the earth. And hath he too\\nExposed this paragon to the fearful usage,\\nAt least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,\\nTo greet a man not worth her pains, much less\\nThe adventure of her person?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nGood my lord,\\nShe came from Libya.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhere the warlike Smalus,\\nThat noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nMost royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter\\nHis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,\\nA prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,\\nTo execute the charge my father gave me\\nFor visiting your highness: my best train\\nI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;\\nWho for Bohemia bend, to signify\\nNot only my success in Libya, sir,\\nBut my arrival and my wife's in safety\\nHere where we are.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThe blessed gods\\nPurge all infection from our air whilst you\\nDo climate here! You have a holy father,\\nA graceful gentleman; against whose person,\\nSo sacred as it is, I have done sin:\\nFor which the heavens, taking angry note,\\nHave left me issueless; and your father's blest,\\nAs he from heaven merits it, with you\\nWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,\\nMight I a son and daughter now have look'd on,\\nSuch goodly things as you!\\n\\nLord:\\nMost noble sir,\\nThat which I shall report will bear no credit,\\nWere not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,\\nBohemia greets you from himself by me;\\nDesires you to attach his son, who has--\\nHis dignity and duty both cast off--\\nFled from his father, from his hopes, and with\\nA shepherd's daughter.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhere's Bohemia? speak.\\n\\nLord:\\nHere in your city; I now came from him:\\nI speak amazedly; and it becomes\\nMy marvel and my message. To your court\\nWhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,\\nOf this fair couple, meets he on the way\\nThe father of this seeming lady and\\nHer brother, having both their country quitted\\nWith this young prince.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nCamillo has betray'd me;\\nWhose honour and whose honesty till now\\nEndured all weathers.\\n\\nLord:\\nLay't so to his charge:\\nHe's with the king your father.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWho? Camillo?\\n\\nLord:\\nCamillo, sir; I spake with him; who now\\nHas these poor men in question. Never saw I\\nWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;\\nForswear themselves as often as they speak:\\nBohemia stops his ears, and threatens them\\nWith divers deaths in death.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO my poor father!\\nThe heaven sets spies upon us, will not have\\nOur contract celebrated.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou are married?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWe are not, sir, nor are we like to be;\\nThe stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:\\nThe odds for high and low's alike.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMy lord,\\nIs this the daughter of a king?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nShe is,\\nWhen once she is my wife.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThat 'once' I see by your good father's speed\\nWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,\\nMost sorry, you have broken from his liking\\nWhere you were tied in duty, and as sorry\\nYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,\\nThat you might well enjoy her.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nDear, look up:\\nThough Fortune, visible an enemy,\\nShould chase us with my father, power no jot\\nHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,\\nRemember since you owed no more to time\\nThan I do now: with thought of such affections,\\nStep forth mine advocate; at your request\\nMy father will grant precious things as trifles.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWould he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,\\nWhich he counts but a trifle.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nSir, my liege,\\nYour eye hath too much youth in't: not a month\\n'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes\\nThan what you look on now.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI thought of her,\\nEven in these looks I made.\\nBut your petition\\nIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:\\nYour honour not o'erthrown by your desires,\\nI am friend to them and you: upon which errand\\nI now go toward him; therefore follow me\\nAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nBeseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old\\nshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:\\nwhereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all\\ncommanded out of the chamber; only this methought I\\nheard the shepherd say, he found the child.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI would most gladly know the issue of it.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI make a broken delivery of the business; but the\\nchanges I perceived in the king and Camillo were\\nvery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with\\nstaring on one another, to tear the cases of their\\neyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language\\nin their very gesture; they looked as they had heard\\nof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable\\npassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest\\nbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not\\nsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the\\nextremity of the one, it must needs be.\\nHere comes a gentleman that haply knows more.\\nThe news, Rogero?\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nNothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the\\nking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is\\nbroken out within this hour that ballad-makers\\ncannot be able to express it.\\nHere comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can\\ndeliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news\\nwhich is called true is so like an old tale, that\\nthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king\\nfound his heir?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nMost true, if ever truth were pregnant by\\ncircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you\\nsee, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle\\nof Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,\\nthe letters of Antigonus found with it which they\\nknow to be his character, the majesty of the\\ncreature in resemblance of the mother, the affection\\nof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,\\nand many other evidences proclaim her with all\\ncertainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see\\nthe meeting of the two kings?\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nNo.\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nThen have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,\\ncannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one\\njoy crown another, so and in such manner that it\\nseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their\\njoy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,\\nholding up of hands, with countenances of such\\ndistraction that they were to be known by garment,\\nnot by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of\\nhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if that\\njoy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,\\nthy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then\\nembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\\ndaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\\nshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\\nconduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such\\nanother encounter, which lames report to follow it\\nand undoes description to do it.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nWhat, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried\\nhence the child?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nLike an old tale still, which will have matter to\\nrehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\\nopen. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this\\navouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his\\ninnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a\\nhandkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWhat became of his bark and his followers?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nWrecked the same instant of their master's death and\\nin the view of the shepherd: so that all the\\ninstruments which aided to expose the child were\\neven then lost when it was found. But O, the noble\\ncombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in\\nPaulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of\\nher husband, another elevated that the oracle was\\nfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,\\nand so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin\\nher to her heart that she might no more be in danger\\nof losing.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nThe dignity of this act was worth the audience of\\nkings and princes; for by such was it acted.\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nOne of the prettiest touches of all and that which\\nangled for mine eyes, caught the water though not\\nthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's\\ndeath, with the manner how she came to't bravely\\nconfessed and lamented by the king, how\\nattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one\\nsign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'\\nI would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my\\nheart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed\\ncolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world\\ncould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nAre they returned to the court?\\n\\nThird Gentleman:\\nNo: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,\\nwhich is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many\\nyears in doing and now newly performed by that rare\\nItalian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself\\neternity and could put breath into his work, would\\nbeguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her\\nape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that\\nthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope of\\nanswer: thither with all greediness of affection\\nare they gone, and there they intend to sup.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nI thought she had some great matter there in hand;\\nfor she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever\\nsince the death of Hermione, visited that removed\\nhouse. Shall we thither and with our company piece\\nthe rejoicing?\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWho would be thence that has the benefit of access?\\nevery wink of an eye some new grace will be born:\\nour absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.\\nLet's along.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNow, had I not the dash of my former life in me,\\nwould preferment drop on my head. I brought the old\\nman and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard\\nthem talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he\\nat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,\\nso he then took her to be, who began to be much\\nsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of\\nweather continuing, this mystery remained\\nundiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I\\nbeen the finder out of this secret, it would not\\nhave relished among my other discredits.\\nHere come those I have done good to against my will,\\nand already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nCome, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and\\ndaughters will be all gentlemen born.\\n\\nClown:\\nYou are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me\\nthis other day, because I was no gentleman born.\\nSee you these clothes? say you see them not and\\nthink me still no gentleman born: you were best say\\nthese robes are not gentlemen born: give me the\\nlie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\\n\\nClown:\\nAy, and have been so any time these four hours.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAnd so have I, boy.\\n\\nClown:\\nSo you have: but I was a gentleman born before my\\nfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, and\\ncalled me brother; and then the two kings called my\\nfather brother; and then the prince my brother and\\nthe princess my sister called my father father; and\\nso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like\\ntears that ever we shed.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWe may live, son, to shed many more.\\n\\nClown:\\nAy; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so\\npreposterous estate as we are.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the\\nfaults I have committed to your worship and to give\\nme your good report to the prince my master.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nPrithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are\\ngentlemen.\\n\\nClown:\\nThou wilt amend thy life?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAy, an it like your good worship.\\n\\nClown:\\nGive me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou\\nart as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nYou may say it, but not swear it.\\n\\nClown:\\nNot swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and\\nfranklins say it, I'll swear it.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nHow if it be false, son?\\n\\nClown:\\nIf it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear\\nit in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to\\nthe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and\\nthat thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no\\ntall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be\\ndrunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst\\nbe a tall fellow of thy hands.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI will prove so, sir, to my power.\\n\\nClown:\\nAy, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not\\nwonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not\\nbeing a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings\\nand the princes, our kindred, are going to see the\\nqueen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy\\ngood masters.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO grave and good Paulina, the great comfort\\nThat I have had of thee!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWhat, sovereign sir,\\nI did not well I meant well. All my services\\nYou have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,\\nWith your crown'd brother and these your contracted\\nHeirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,\\nIt is a surplus of your grace, which never\\nMy life may last to answer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO Paulina,\\nWe honour you with trouble: but we came\\nTo see the statue of our queen: your gallery\\nHave we pass'd through, not without much content\\nIn many singularities; but we saw not\\nThat which my daughter came to look upon,\\nThe statue of her mother.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nAs she lived peerless,\\nSo her dead likeness, I do well believe,\\nExcels whatever yet you look'd upon\\nOr hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it\\nLonely, apart. But here it is: prepare\\nTo see the life as lively mock'd as ever\\nStill sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.\\nI like your silence, it the more shows off\\nYour wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,\\nComes it not something near?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHer natural posture!\\nChide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed\\nThou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she\\nIn thy not chiding, for she was as tender\\nAs infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,\\nHermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing\\nSo aged as this seems.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO, not by much.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nSo much the more our carver's excellence;\\nWhich lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\\nAs she lived now.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAs now she might have done,\\nSo much to my good comfort, as it is\\nNow piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,\\nEven with such life of majesty, warm life,\\nAs now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!\\nI am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me\\nFor being more stone than it? O royal piece,\\nThere's magic in thy majesty, which has\\nMy evils conjured to remembrance and\\nFrom thy admiring daughter took the spirits,\\nStanding like stone with thee.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nAnd give me leave,\\nAnd do not say 'tis superstition, that\\nI kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,\\nDear queen, that ended when I but began,\\nGive me that hand of yours to kiss.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nO, patience!\\nThe statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\\nWhich sixteen winters cannot blow away,\\nSo many summers dry; scarce any joy\\nDid ever so long live; no sorrow\\nBut kill'd itself much sooner.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nDear my brother,\\nLet him that was the cause of this have power\\nTo take off so much grief from you as he\\nWill piece up in himself.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nIndeed, my lord,\\nIf I had thought the sight of my poor image\\nWould thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--\\nI'ld not have show'd it.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDo not draw the curtain.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNo longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy\\nMay think anon it moves.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nLet be, let be.\\nWould I were dead, but that, methinks, already--\\nWhat was he that did make it? See, my lord,\\nWould you not deem it breathed? and that those veins\\nDid verily bear blood?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMasterly done:\\nThe very life seems warm upon her lip.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThe fixture of her eye has motion in't,\\nAs we are mock'd with art.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI'll draw the curtain:\\nMy lord's almost so far transported that\\nHe'll think anon it lives.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO sweet Paulina,\\nMake me to think so twenty years together!\\nNo settled senses of the world can match\\nThe pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but\\nI could afflict you farther.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDo, Paulina;\\nFor this affliction has a taste as sweet\\nAs any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,\\nThere is an air comes from her: what fine chisel\\nCould ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,\\nFor I will kiss her.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood my lord, forbear:\\nThe ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\\nYou'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\\nWith oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, not these twenty years.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSo long could I\\nStand by, a looker on.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nEither forbear,\\nQuit presently the chapel, or resolve you\\nFor more amazement. If you can behold it,\\nI'll make the statue move indeed, descend\\nAnd take you by the hand; but then you'll think--\\nWhich I protest against--I am assisted\\nBy wicked powers.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat you can make her do,\\nI am content to look on: what to speak,\\nI am content to hear; for 'tis as easy\\nTo make her speak as move.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nIt is required\\nYou do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\\nOn: those that think it is unlawful business\\nI am about, let them depart.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nProceed:\\nNo foot shall stir.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nMusic, awake her; strike!\\n'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\\nStrike all that look upon with marvel. Come,\\nI'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,\\nBequeath to death your numbness, for from him\\nDear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:\\nStart not; her actions shall be holy as\\nYou hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her\\nUntil you see her die again; for then\\nYou kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\\nWhen she was young you woo'd her; now in age\\nIs she become the suitor?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO, she's warm!\\nIf this be magic, let it be an art\\nLawful as eating.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShe embraces him.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nShe hangs about his neck:\\nIf she pertain to life let her speak too.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAy, and make't manifest where she has lived,\\nOr how stolen from the dead.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThat she is living,\\nWere it but told you, should be hooted at\\nLike an old tale: but it appears she lives,\\nThough yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\\nPlease you to interpose, fair madam: kneel\\nAnd pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;\\nOur Perdita is found.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nYou gods, look down\\nAnd from your sacred vials pour your graces\\nUpon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.\\nWhere hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\\nThy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,\\nKnowing by Paulina that the oracle\\nGave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\\nMyself to see the issue.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThere's time enough for that;\\nLest they desire upon this push to trouble\\nYour joys with like relation. Go together,\\nYou precious winners all; your exultation\\nPartake to every one. I, an old turtle,\\nWill wing me to some wither'd bough and there\\nMy mate, that's never to be found again,\\nLament till I am lost.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nO, peace, Paulina!\\nThou shouldst a husband take by my consent,\\nAs I by thine a wife: this is a match,\\nAnd made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;\\nBut how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,\\nAs I thought, dead, and have in vain said many\\nA prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--\\nFor him, I partly know his mind--to find thee\\nAn honourable husband. Come, Camillo,\\nAnd take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty\\nIs richly noted and here justified\\nBy us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.\\nWhat! look upon my brother: both your pardons,\\nThat e'er I put between your holy looks\\nMy ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,\\nAnd son unto the king, who, heavens directing,\\nIs troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,\\nLead us from hence, where we may leisurely\\nEach one demand an answer to his part\\nPerform'd in this wide gap of time since first\\nWe were dissever'd: hastily lead away.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nEscalus.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nMy lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nOf government the properties to unfold,\\nWould seem in me to affect speech and discourse;\\nSince I am put to know that your own science\\nExceeds, in that, the lists of all advice\\nMy strength can give you: then no more remains,\\nBut that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,\\nAnd let them work. The nature of our people,\\nOur city's institutions, and the terms\\nFor common justice, you're as pregnant in\\nAs art and practise hath enriched any\\nThat we remember. There is our commission,\\nFrom which we would not have you warp. Call hither,\\nI say, bid come before us Angelo.\\nWhat figure of us think you he will bear?\\nFor you must know, we have with special soul\\nElected him our absence to supply,\\nLent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,\\nAnd given his deputation all the organs\\nOf our own power: what think you of it?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIf any in Vienna be of worth\\nTo undergo such ample grace and honour,\\nIt is Lord Angelo.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLook where he comes.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAlways obedient to your grace's will,\\nI come to know your pleasure.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAngelo,\\nThere is a kind of character in thy life,\\nThat to the observer doth thy history\\nFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings\\nAre not thine own so proper as to waste\\nThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.\\nHeaven doth with us as we with torches do,\\nNot light them for themselves; for if our virtues\\nDid not go forth of us, 'twere all alike\\nAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd\\nBut to fine issues, nor Nature never lends\\nThe smallest scruple of her excellence\\nBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determines\\nHerself the glory of a creditor,\\nBoth thanks and use. But I do bend my speech\\nTo one that can my part in him advertise;\\nHold therefore, Angelo:--\\nIn our remove be thou at full ourself;\\nMortality and mercy in Vienna\\nLive in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,\\nThough first in question, is thy secondary.\\nTake thy commission.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNow, good my lord,\\nLet there be some more test made of my metal,\\nBefore so noble and so great a figure\\nBe stamp'd upon it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo more evasion:\\nWe have with a leaven'd and prepared choice\\nProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.\\nOur haste from hence is of so quick condition\\nThat it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd\\nMatters of needful value.

Let us withdraw together,\\nAnd we may soon our satisfaction have\\nTouching that point.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI'll wait upon your honour.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIf the duke with the other dukes come not to\\ncomposition with the King of Hungary, why then all\\nthe dukes fall upon the king.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nHeaven grant us its peace, but not the King of\\nHungary's!\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nAmen.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that\\nwent to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped\\none out of the table.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\n'Thou shalt not steal'?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAy, that he razed.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWhy, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and\\nall the rest from their functions: they put forth\\nto steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in\\nthe thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition\\nwell that prays for peace.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nI never heard any soldier dislike it.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI believe thee; for I think thou never wast where\\ngrace was said.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nNo? a dozen times at least.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWhat, in metre?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIn any proportion or in any language.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI think, or in any religion.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAy, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all\\ncontroversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a\\nwicked villain, despite of all grace.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nWell, there went but a pair of shears between us.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI grant; as there may between the lists and the\\nvelvet. Thou art the list.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nAnd thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt\\na three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief\\nbe a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou\\nart piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak\\nfeelingly now?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful\\nfeeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own\\nconfession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I\\nlive, forget to drink after thee.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nI think I have done myself wrong, have I not?\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nYes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBehold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I\\nhave purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nTo what, I pray?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nJudge.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nTo three thousand dolours a year.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nAy, and more.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA French crown more.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nThou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou\\nart full of error; I am sound.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as\\nthings that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;\\nimpiety has made a feast of thee.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nHow now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWell, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried\\nto prison was worth five thousand of you all.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nWho's that, I pray thee?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nMarry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nClaudio to prison? 'tis not so.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nNay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw\\nhim carried away; and, which is more, within these\\nthree days his head to be chopped off.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBut, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.\\nArt thou sure of this?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nI am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam\\nJulietta with child.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBelieve me, this may be: he promised to meet me two\\nhours since, and he was ever precise in\\npromise-keeping.\\n\\nSecond Gentleman:\\nBesides, you know, it draws something near to the\\nspeech we had to such a purpose.\\n\\nFirst Gentleman:\\nBut, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAway! let's go learn the truth of it.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what\\nwith the gallows and what with poverty, I am\\ncustom-shrunk.\\nHow now! what's the news with you?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYonder man is carried to prison.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWell; what has he done?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nA woman.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nBut what's his offence?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nGroping for trouts in a peculiar river.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhat, is there a maid with child by him?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNo, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have\\nnot heard of the proclamation, have you?\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhat proclamation, man?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nAll houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nAnd what shall become of those in the city?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nThey shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,\\nbut that a wise burgher put in for them.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nBut shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be\\npulled down?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTo the ground, mistress.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhy, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!\\nWhat shall become of me?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nCome; fear you not: good counsellors lack no\\nclients: though you change your place, you need not\\nchange your trade; I'll be your tapster still.\\nCourage! there will be pity taken on you: you that\\nhave worn your eyes almost out in the service, you\\nwill be considered.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nWhat's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nHere comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to\\nprison; and there's Madam Juliet.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nFellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?\\nBear me to prison, where I am committed.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI do it not in evil disposition,\\nBut from Lord Angelo by special charge.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThus can the demigod Authority\\nMake us pay down for our offence by weight\\nThe words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;\\nOn whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nFrom too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:\\nAs surfeit is the father of much fast,\\nSo every scope by the immoderate use\\nTurns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,\\nLike rats that ravin down their proper bane,\\nA thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIf could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would\\nsend for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say\\nthe truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom\\nas the morality of imprisonment. What's thy\\noffence, Claudio?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nWhat but to speak of would offend again.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhat, is't murder?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nNo.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nLechery?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nCall it so.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAway, sir! you must go.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nOne word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA hundred, if they'll do you any good.\\nIs lechery so look'd after?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThus stands it with me: upon a true contract\\nI got possession of Julietta's bed:\\nYou know the lady; she is fast my wife,\\nSave that we do the denunciation lack\\nOf outward order: this we came not to,\\nOnly for propagation of a dower\\nRemaining in the coffer of her friends,\\nFrom whom we thought it meet to hide our love\\nTill time had made them for us. But it chances\\nThe stealth of our most mutual entertainment\\nWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWith child, perhaps?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nUnhappily, even so.\\nAnd the new deputy now for the duke--\\nWhether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,\\nOr whether that the body public be\\nA horse whereon the governor doth ride,\\nWho, newly in the seat, that it may know\\nHe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;\\nWhether the tyranny be in his place,\\nOr in his emmence that fills it up,\\nI stagger in:--but this new governor\\nAwakes me all the enrolled penalties\\nWhich have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall\\nSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round\\nAnd none of them been worn; and, for a name,\\nNow puts the drowsy and neglected act\\nFreshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on\\nthy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,\\nmay sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to\\nhim.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nI have done so, but he's not to be found.\\nI prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:\\nThis day my sister should the cloister enter\\nAnd there receive her approbation:\\nAcquaint her with the danger of my state:\\nImplore her, in my voice, that she make friends\\nTo the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:\\nI have great hope in that; for in her youth\\nThere is a prone and speechless dialect,\\nSuch as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art\\nWhen she will play with reason and discourse,\\nAnd well she can persuade.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the\\nlike, which else would stand under grievous\\nimposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I\\nwould be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a\\ngame of tick-tack. I'll to her.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nI thank you, good friend Lucio.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWithin two hours.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nCome, officer, away!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo, holy father; throw away that thought;\\nBelieve not that the dribbling dart of love\\nCan pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee\\nTo give me secret harbour, hath a purpose\\nMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends\\nOf burning youth.\\n\\nFRIAR THOMAS:\\nMay your grace speak of it?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMy holy sir, none better knows than you\\nHow I have ever loved the life removed\\nAnd held in idle price to haunt assemblies\\nWhere youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.\\nI have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,\\nA man of stricture and firm abstinence,\\nMy absolute power and place here in Vienna,\\nAnd he supposes me travell'd to Poland;\\nFor so I have strew'd it in the common ear,\\nAnd so it is received. Now, pious sir,\\nYou will demand of me why I do this?\\n\\nFRIAR THOMAS:\\nGladly, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWe have strict statutes and most biting laws.\\nThe needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,\\nWhich for this nineteen years we have let slip;\\nEven like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,\\nThat goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,\\nHaving bound up the threatening twigs of birch,\\nOnly to stick it in their children's sight\\nFor terror, not to use, in time the rod\\nBecomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,\\nDead to infliction, to themselves are dead;\\nAnd liberty plucks justice by the nose;\\nThe baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart\\nGoes all decorum.\\n\\nFRIAR THOMAS:\\nIt rested in your grace\\nTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:\\nAnd it in you more dreadful would have seem'd\\nThan in Lord Angelo.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI do fear, too dreadful:\\nSith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,\\n'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them\\nFor what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,\\nWhen evil deeds have their permissive pass\\nAnd not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,\\nI have on Angelo imposed the office;\\nWho may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,\\nAnd yet my nature never in the fight\\nTo do in slander. And to behold his sway,\\nI will, as 'twere a brother of your order,\\nVisit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,\\nSupply me with the habit and instruct me\\nHow I may formally in person bear me\\nLike a true friar. More reasons for this action\\nAt our more leisure shall I render you;\\nOnly, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;\\nStands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses\\nThat his blood flows, or that his appetite\\nIs more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,\\nIf power change purpose, what our seemers be.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd have you nuns no farther privileges?\\n\\nFRANCISCA:\\nAre not these large enough?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;\\nBut rather wishing a more strict restraint\\nUpon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWho's that which calls?\\n\\nFRANCISCA:\\nIt is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,\\nTurn you the key, and know his business of him;\\nYou may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.\\nWhen you have vow'd, you must not speak with men\\nBut in the presence of the prioress:\\nThen, if you speak, you must not show your face,\\nOr, if you show your face, you must not speak.\\nHe calls again; I pray you, answer him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nPeace and prosperity! Who is't that calls\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses\\nProclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me\\nAs bring me to the sight of Isabella,\\nA novice of this place and the fair sister\\nTo her unhappy brother Claudio?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhy 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,\\nThe rather for I now must make you know\\nI am that Isabella and his sister.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nGentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:\\nNot to be weary with you, he's in prison.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWoe me! for what?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nFor that which, if myself might be his judge,\\nHe should receive his punishment in thanks:\\nHe hath got his friend with child.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSir, make me not your story.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIt is true.\\nI would not--though 'tis my familiar sin\\nWith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,\\nTongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:\\nI hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.\\nBy your renouncement an immortal spirit,\\nAnd to be talk'd with in sincerity,\\nAs with a saint.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYou do blaspheme the good in mocking me.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nDo not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:\\nYour brother and his lover have embraced:\\nAs those that feed grow full, as blossoming time\\nThat from the seedness the bare fallow brings\\nTo teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb\\nExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSome one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIs she your cousin?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAdoptedly; as school-maids change their names\\nBy vain though apt affection.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nShe it is.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, let him marry her.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThis is the point.\\nThe duke is very strangely gone from hence;\\nBore many gentlemen, myself being one,\\nIn hand and hope of action: but we do learn\\nBy those that know the very nerves of state,\\nHis givings-out were of an infinite distance\\nFrom his true-meant design. Upon his place,\\nAnd with full line of his authority,\\nGoverns Lord Angelo; a man whose blood\\nIs very snow-broth; one who never feels\\nThe wanton stings and motions of the sense,\\nBut doth rebate and blunt his natural edge\\nWith profits of the mind, study and fast.\\nHe--to give fear to use and liberty,\\nWhich have for long run by the hideous law,\\nAs mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,\\nUnder whose heavy sense your brother's life\\nFalls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;\\nAnd follows close the rigour of the statute,\\nTo make him an example. All hope is gone,\\nUnless you have the grace by your fair prayer\\nTo soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business\\n'Twixt you and your poor brother.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nDoth he so seek his life?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHas censured him\\nAlready; and, as I hear, the provost hath\\nA warrant for his execution.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAlas! what poor ability's in me\\nTo do him good?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAssay the power you have.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMy power? Alas, I doubt--\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nOur doubts are traitors\\nAnd make us lose the good we oft might win\\nBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,\\nAnd let him learn to know, when maidens sue,\\nMen give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,\\nAll their petitions are as freely theirs\\nAs they themselves would owe them.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI'll see what I can do.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBut speedily.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI will about it straight;\\nNo longer staying but to give the mother\\nNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you:\\nCommend me to my brother: soon at night\\nI'll send him certain word of my success.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI take my leave of you.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nGood sir, adieu.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWe must not make a scarecrow of the law,\\nSetting it up to fear the birds of prey,\\nAnd let it keep one shape, till custom make it\\nTheir perch and not their terror.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAy, but yet\\nLet us be keen, and rather cut a little,\\nThan fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman\\nWhom I would save, had a most noble father!\\nLet but your honour know,\\nWhom I believe to be most strait in virtue,\\nThat, in the working of your own affections,\\nHad time cohered with place or place with wishing,\\nOr that the resolute acting of your blood\\nCould have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,\\nWhether you had not sometime in your life\\nErr'd in this point which now you censure him,\\nAnd pull'd the law upon you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\n'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,\\nAnother thing to fall. I not deny,\\nThe jury, passing on the prisoner's life,\\nMay in the sworn twelve have a thief or two\\nGuiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,\\nThat justice seizes: what know the laws\\nThat thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,\\nThe jewel that we find, we stoop and take't\\nBecause we see it; but what we do not see\\nWe tread upon, and never think of it.\\nYou may not so extenuate his offence\\nFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,\\nWhen I, that censure him, do so offend,\\nLet mine own judgment pattern out my death,\\nAnd nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nBe it as your wisdom will.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhere is the provost?\\n\\nProvost:\\nHere, if it like your honour.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nSee that Claudio\\nBe executed by nine to-morrow morning:\\nBring him his confessor, let him be prepared;\\nFor that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome, bring them away: if these be good people in\\na commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in\\ncommon houses, I know no law: bring them away.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHow now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nIf it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's\\nconstable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon\\njustice, sir, and do bring in here before your good\\nhonour two notorious benefactors.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nBenefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are\\nthey not malefactors?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nIf it? please your honour, I know not well what they\\nare: but precise villains they are, that I am sure\\nof; and void of all profanation in the world that\\ngood Christians ought to have.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThis comes off well; here's a wise officer.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nGo to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your\\nname? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nHe cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhat are you, sir?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nHe, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that\\nserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they\\nsay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she\\nprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow know you that?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMy wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow? thy wife?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nAy, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nDost thou detest her therefore?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nI say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as\\nshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,\\nit is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow dost thou know that, constable?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman\\ncardinally given, might have been accused in\\nfornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nBy the woman's means?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nAy, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she\\nspit in his face, so she defied him.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, if it please your honour, this is not so.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nProve it before these varlets here, thou honourable\\nman; prove it.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nDo you hear how he misplaces?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, she came in great with child; and longing,\\nsaving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;\\nsir, we had but two in the house, which at that very\\ndistant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a\\ndish of some three-pence; your honours have seen\\nsuch dishes; they are not China dishes, but very\\ngood dishes,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nGo to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNo, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in\\nthe right: but to the point. As I say, this\\nMistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and\\nbeing great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for\\nprunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,\\nMaster Froth here, this very man, having eaten the\\nrest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very\\nhonestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could\\nnot give you three-pence again.\\n\\nFROTH:\\nNo, indeed.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nVery well: you being then, if you be remembered,\\ncracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--\\n\\nFROTH:\\nAy, so I did indeed.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well; I telling you then, if you be\\nremembered, that such a one and such a one were past\\ncure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very\\ngood diet, as I told you,--\\n\\nFROTH:\\nAll this is true.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well, then,--\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What\\nwas done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to\\ncomplain of? Come me to what was done to her.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, your honour cannot come to that yet.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nNo, sir, nor I mean it not.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's\\nleave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth\\nhere, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose\\nfather died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,\\nMaster Froth?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nAll-hallond eve.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,\\nsitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in\\nthe Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight\\nto sit, have you not?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nI have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nWhy, very well, then; I hope here be truths.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThis will last out a night in Russia,\\nWhen nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.\\nAnd leave you to the hearing of the cause;\\nHoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.\\nNow, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nOnce, sir? there was nothing done to her once.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nI beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI beseech your honour, ask me.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWell, sir; what did this gentleman to her?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.\\nGood Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a\\ngood purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAy, sir, very well.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNay; I beseech you, mark it well.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWell, I do so.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nDoth your honour see any harm in his face?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhy, no.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst\\nthing about him. Good, then; if his face be the\\nworst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the\\nconstable's wife any harm? I would know that of\\nyour honour.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHe's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nFirst, an it like you, the house is a respected\\nhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and his\\nmistress is a respected woman.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nBy this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected\\nperson than any of us all.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nVarlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the\\ntime has yet to come that she was ever respected\\nwith man, woman, or child.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, she was respected with him before he married with her.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhich is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is\\nthis true?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nO thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked\\nHannibal! I respected with her before I was married\\nto her! If ever I was respected with her, or she\\nwith me, let not your worship think me the poor\\nduke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or\\nI'll have mine action of battery on thee.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIf he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your\\naction of slander too.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't\\nyour worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nTruly, officer, because he hath some offences in him\\nthat thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him\\ncontinue in his courses till thou knowest what they\\nare.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou\\nwicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art\\nto continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhere were you born, friend?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nHere in Vienna, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAre you of fourscore pounds a year?\\n\\nFROTH:\\nYes, an't please you, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nSo. What trade are you of, sir?\\n\\nPOMPHEY:\\nTapster; a poor widow's tapster.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nYour mistress' name?\\n\\nPOMPHEY:\\nMistress Overdone.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHath she had any more than one husband?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nNine, sir; Overdone by the last.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nNine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master\\nFroth, I would not have you acquainted with\\ntapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you\\nwill hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no\\nmore of you.\\n\\nFROTH:\\nI thank your worship. For mine own part, I never\\ncome into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn\\nin.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWell, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.\\nCome you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your\\nname, Master tapster?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPompey.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhat else?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nBum, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nTroth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;\\nso that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the\\nGreat. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,\\nhowsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you\\nnot? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTruly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What\\ndo you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIf the law would allow it, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nBut the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall\\nnot be allowed in Vienna.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nDoes your worship mean to geld and splay all the\\nyouth of the city?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nNo, Pompey.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTruly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.\\nIf your worship will take order for the drabs and\\nthe knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThere are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:\\nit is but heading and hanging.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIf you head and hang all that offend that way but\\nfor ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a\\ncommission for more heads: if this law hold in\\nVienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it\\nafter three-pence a bay: if you live to see this\\ncome to pass, say Pompey told you so.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your\\nprophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find\\nyou before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;\\nno, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,\\nI shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd\\nCaesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall\\nhave you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI thank your worship for your good counsel:\\nbut I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall\\nbetter determine.\\nWhip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:\\nThe valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master\\nconstable. How long have you been in this place of constable?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nSeven year and a half, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI thought, by your readiness in the office, you had\\ncontinued in it some time. You say, seven years together?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nAnd a half, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nAlas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you\\nwrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men\\nin your ward sufficient to serve it?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nFaith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they\\nare chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I\\ndo it for some piece of money, and go through with\\nall.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nLook you bring me in the names of some six or seven,\\nthe most sufficient of your parish.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nTo your worship's house, sir?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nTo my house. Fare you well.\\nWhat's o'clock, think you?\\n\\nJustice:\\nEleven, sir.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI pray you home to dinner with me.\\n\\nJustice:\\nI humbly thank you.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIt grieves me for the death of Claudio;\\nBut there's no remedy.\\n\\nJustice:\\nLord Angelo is severe.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIt is but needful:\\nMercy is not itself, that oft looks so;\\nPardon is still the nurse of second woe:\\nBut yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.\\nCome, sir.\\n\\nServant:\\nHe's hearing of a cause; he will come straight\\nI'll tell him of you.\\n\\nProvost:\\nPray you, do.\\nI'll know\\nHis pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,\\nHe hath but as offended in a dream!\\nAll sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he\\nTo die for't!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNow, what's the matter. Provost?\\n\\nProvost:\\nIs it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nDid not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?\\nWhy dost thou ask again?\\n\\nProvost:\\nLest I might be too rash:\\nUnder your good correction, I have seen,\\nWhen, after execution, judgment hath\\nRepented o'er his doom.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nGo to; let that be mine:\\nDo you your office, or give up your place,\\nAnd you shall well be spared.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI crave your honour's pardon.\\nWhat shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?\\nShe's very near her hour.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nDispose of her\\nTo some more fitter place, and that with speed.\\n\\nServant:\\nHere is the sister of the man condemn'd\\nDesires access to you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHath he a sister?\\n\\nProvost:\\nAy, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,\\nAnd to be shortly of a sisterhood,\\nIf not already.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell, let her be admitted.\\nSee you the fornicatress be removed:\\nLet have needful, but not lavish, means;\\nThere shall be order for't.\\n\\nProvost:\\nGod save your honour!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nStay a little while.\\nYou're welcome: what's your will?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am a woeful suitor to your honour,\\nPlease but your honour hear me.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell; what's your suit?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThere is a vice that most I do abhor,\\nAnd most desire should meet the blow of justice;\\nFor which I would not plead, but that I must;\\nFor which I must not plead, but that I am\\nAt war 'twixt will and will not.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell; the matter?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have a brother is condemn'd to die:\\nI do beseech you, let it be his fault,\\nAnd not my brother.\\n\\nProvost:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nCondemn the fault and not the actor of it?\\nWhy, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:\\nMine were the very cipher of a function,\\nTo fine the faults whose fine stands in record,\\nAnd let go by the actor.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO just but severe law!\\nI had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMust he needs die?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nMaiden, no remedy.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes; I do think that you might pardon him,\\nAnd neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI will not do't.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBut can you, if you would?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nLook, what I will not, that I cannot do.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBut might you do't, and do the world no wrong,\\nIf so your heart were touch'd with that remorse\\nAs mine is to him?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHe's sentenced; 'tis too late.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nToo late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.\\nMay call it back again. Well, believe this,\\nNo ceremony that to great ones 'longs,\\nNot the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,\\nThe marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,\\nBecome them with one half so good a grace\\nAs mercy does.\\nIf he had been as you and you as he,\\nYou would have slipt like him; but he, like you,\\nWould not have been so stern.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nPray you, be gone.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI would to heaven I had your potency,\\nAnd you were Isabel! should it then be thus?\\nNo; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,\\nAnd what a prisoner.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYour brother is a forfeit of the law,\\nAnd you but waste your words.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAlas, alas!\\nWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit once;\\nAnd He that might the vantage best have took\\nFound out the remedy. How would you be,\\nIf He, which is the top of judgment, should\\nBut judge you as you are? O, think on that;\\nAnd mercy then will breathe within your lips,\\nLike man new made.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nBe you content, fair maid;\\nIt is the law, not I condemn your brother:\\nWere he my kinsman, brother, or my son,\\nIt should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTo-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!\\nHe's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens\\nWe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven\\nWith less respect than we do minister\\nTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;\\nWho is it that hath died for this offence?\\nThere's many have committed it.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThe law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:\\nThose many had not dared to do that evil,\\nIf the first that did the edict infringe\\nHad answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake\\nTakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,\\nLooks in a glass, that shows what future evils,\\nEither new, or by remissness new-conceived,\\nAnd so in progress to be hatch'd and born,\\nAre now to have no successive degrees,\\nBut, ere they live, to end.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYet show some pity.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI show it most of all when I show justice;\\nFor then I pity those I do not know,\\nWhich a dismiss'd offence would after gall;\\nAnd do him right that, answering one foul wrong,\\nLives not to act another. Be satisfied;\\nYour brother dies to-morrow; be content.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSo you must be the first that gives this sentence,\\nAnd he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent\\nTo have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous\\nTo use it like a giant.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nCould great men thunder\\nAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,\\nFor every pelting, petty officer\\nWould use his heaven for thunder;\\nNothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,\\nThou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\\nSplit'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak\\nThan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,\\nDrest in a little brief authority,\\nMost ignorant of what he's most assured,\\nHis glassy essence, like an angry ape,\\nPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\\nAs make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,\\nWould all themselves laugh mortal.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nProvost:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself:\\nGreat men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,\\nBut in the less foul profanation.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThat in the captain's but a choleric word,\\nWhich in the soldier is flat blasphemy.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhy do you put these sayings upon me?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBecause authority, though it err like others,\\nHath yet a kind of medicine in itself,\\nThat skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;\\nKnock there, and ask your heart what it doth know\\nThat's like my brother's fault: if it confess\\nA natural guiltiness such as is his,\\nLet it not sound a thought upon your tongue\\nAgainst my brother's life.\\n\\nANGELO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nGentle my lord, turn back.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI will bethink me: come again tomorrow.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHow! bribe me?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAy, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNot with fond shekels of the tested gold,\\nOr stones whose rates are either rich or poor\\nAs fancy values them; but with true prayers\\nThat shall be up at heaven and enter there\\nEre sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,\\nFrom fasting maids whose minds are dedicate\\nTo nothing temporal.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell; come to me to-morrow.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHeaven keep your honour safe!\\n\\nANGELO:\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAt what hour to-morrow\\nShall I attend your lordship?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAt any time 'fore noon.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n'Save your honour!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nFrom thee, even from thy virtue!\\nWhat's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?\\nThe tempter or the tempted, who sins most?\\nHa!\\nNot she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I\\nThat, lying by the violet in the sun,\\nDo as the carrion does, not as the flower,\\nCorrupt with virtuous season. Can it be\\nThat modesty may more betray our sense\\nThan woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,\\nShall we desire to raze the sanctuary\\nAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!\\nWhat dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?\\nDost thou desire her foully for those things\\nThat make her good? O, let her brother live!\\nThieves for their robbery have authority\\nWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,\\nThat I desire to hear her speak again,\\nAnd feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?\\nO cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,\\nWith saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous\\nIs that temptation that doth goad us on\\nTo sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,\\nWith all her double vigour, art and nature,\\nOnce stir my temper; but this virtuous maid\\nSubdues me quite. Even till now,\\nWhen men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHail to you, provost! so I think you are.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI am the provost. What's your will, good friar?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBound by my charity and my blest order,\\nI come to visit the afflicted spirits\\nHere in the prison. Do me the common right\\nTo let me see them and to make me know\\nThe nature of their crimes, that I may minister\\nTo them accordingly.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI would do more than that, if more were needful.\\nLook, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,\\nWho, falling in the flaws of her own youth,\\nHath blister'd her report: she is with child;\\nAnd he that got it, sentenced; a young man\\nMore fit to do another such offence\\nThan die for this.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhen must he die?\\n\\nProvost:\\nAs I do think, to-morrow.\\nI have provided for you: stay awhile,\\nAnd you shall be conducted.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nRepent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI do; and bear the shame most patiently.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,\\nAnd try your penitence, if it be sound,\\nOr hollowly put on.\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI'll gladly learn.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLove you the man that wrong'd you?\\n\\nJULIET:\\nYes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSo then it seems your most offenceful act\\nWas mutually committed?\\n\\nJULIET:\\nMutually.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThen was your sin of heavier kind than his.\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI do confess it, and repent it, father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,\\nAs that the sin hath brought you to this shame,\\nWhich sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,\\nShowing we would not spare heaven as we love it,\\nBut as we stand in fear,--\\n\\nJULIET:\\nI do repent me, as it is an evil,\\nAnd take the shame with joy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThere rest.\\nYour partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,\\nAnd I am going with instruction to him.\\nGrace go with you, Benedicite!\\n\\nJULIET:\\nMust die to-morrow! O injurious love,\\nThat respites me a life, whose very comfort\\nIs still a dying horror!\\n\\nProvost:\\n'Tis pity of him.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhen I would pray and think, I think and pray\\nTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;\\nWhilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,\\nAnchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,\\nAs if I did but only chew his name;\\nAnd in my heart the strong and swelling evil\\nOf my conception. The state, whereon I studied\\nIs like a good thing, being often read,\\nGrown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,\\nWherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,\\nCould I with boot change for an idle plume,\\nWhich the air beats for vain. O place, O form,\\nHow often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,\\nWrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls\\nTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:\\nLet's write good angel on the devil's horn:\\n'Tis not the devil's crest.\\nHow now! who's there?\\n\\nServant:\\nOne Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nTeach her the way.\\nO heavens!\\nWhy does my blood thus muster to my heart,\\nMaking both it unable for itself,\\nAnd dispossessing all my other parts\\nOf necessary fitness?\\nSo play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;\\nCome all to help him, and so stop the air\\nBy which he should revive: and even so\\nThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,\\nQuit their own part, and in obsequious fondness\\nCrowd to his presence, where their untaught love\\nMust needs appear offence.\\nHow now, fair maid?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am come to know your pleasure.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThat you might know it, would much better please me\\nThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nEven so. Heaven keep your honour!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYet may he live awhile; and, it may be,\\nAs long as you or I yet he must die.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nUnder your sentence?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYea.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhen, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,\\nLonger or shorter, he may be so fitted\\nThat his soul sicken not.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHa! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good\\nTo pardon him that hath from nature stolen\\nA man already made, as to remit\\nTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image\\nIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy\\nFalsely to take away a life true made\\nAs to put metal in restrained means\\nTo make a false one.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nSay you so? then I shall pose you quickly.\\nWhich had you rather, that the most just law\\nNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,\\nGive up your body to such sweet uncleanness\\nAs she that he hath stain'd?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSir, believe this,\\nI had rather give my body than my soul.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins\\nStand more for number than for accompt.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHow say you?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak\\nAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:\\nI, now the voice of the recorded law,\\nPronounce a sentence on your brother's life:\\nMight there not be a charity in sin\\nTo save this brother's life?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nPlease you to do't,\\nI'll take it as a peril to my soul,\\nIt is no sin at all, but charity.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nPleased you to do't at peril of your soul,\\nWere equal poise of sin and charity.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,\\nHeaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,\\nIf that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer\\nTo have it added to the faults of mine,\\nAnd nothing of your answer.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNay, but hear me.\\nYour sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,\\nOr seem so craftily; and that's not good.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nLet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,\\nBut graciously to know I am no better.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThus wisdom wishes to appear most bright\\nWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masks\\nProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder\\nThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;\\nTo be received plain, I'll speak more gross:\\nYour brother is to die.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nSo.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAnd his offence is so, as it appears,\\nAccountant to the law upon that pain.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTrue.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAdmit no other way to save his life,--\\nAs I subscribe not that, nor any other,\\nBut in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,\\nFinding yourself desired of such a person,\\nWhose credit with the judge, or own great place,\\nCould fetch your brother from the manacles\\nOf the all-building law; and that there were\\nNo earthly mean to save him, but that either\\nYou must lay down the treasures of your body\\nTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;\\nWhat would you do?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAs much for my poor brother as myself:\\nThat is, were I under the terms of death,\\nThe impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,\\nAnd strip myself to death, as to a bed\\nThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield\\nMy body up to shame.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThen must your brother die.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd 'twere the cheaper way:\\nBetter it were a brother died at once,\\nThan that a sister, by redeeming him,\\nShould die for ever.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWere not you then as cruel as the sentence\\nThat you have slander'd so?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIgnomy in ransom and free pardon\\nAre of two houses: lawful mercy\\nIs nothing kin to foul redemption.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYou seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;\\nAnd rather proved the sliding of your brother\\nA merriment than a vice.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,\\nTo have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:\\nI something do excuse the thing I hate,\\nFor his advantage that I dearly love.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWe are all frail.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nElse let my brother die,\\nIf not a feodary, but only he\\nOwe and succeed thy weakness.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nNay, women are frail too.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAy, as the glasses where they view themselves;\\nWhich are as easy broke as they make forms.\\nWomen! Help Heaven! men their creation mar\\nIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;\\nFor we are soft as our complexions are,\\nAnd credulous to false prints.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI think it well:\\nAnd from this testimony of your own sex,--\\nSince I suppose we are made to be no stronger\\nThan faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;\\nI do arrest your words. Be that you are,\\nThat is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;\\nIf you be one, as you are well express'd\\nBy all external warrants, show it now,\\nBy putting on the destined livery.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,\\nLet me entreat you speak the former language.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nPlainly conceive, I love you.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMy brother did love Juliet,\\nAnd you tell me that he shall die for it.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI know your virtue hath a licence in't,\\nWhich seems a little fouler than it is,\\nTo pluck on others.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nBelieve me, on mine honour,\\nMy words express my purpose.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHa! little honour to be much believed,\\nAnd most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!\\nI will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:\\nSign me a present pardon for my brother,\\nOr with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud\\nWhat man thou art.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWho will believe thee, Isabel?\\nMy unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,\\nMy vouch against you, and my place i' the state,\\nWill so your accusation overweigh,\\nThat you shall stifle in your own report\\nAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,\\nAnd now I give my sensual race the rein:\\nFit thy consent to my sharp appetite;\\nLay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,\\nThat banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother\\nBy yielding up thy body to my will;\\nOr else he must not only die the death,\\nBut thy unkindness shall his death draw out\\nTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,\\nOr, by the affection that now guides me most,\\nI'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,\\nSay what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,\\nWho would believe me? O perilous mouths,\\nThat bear in them one and the self-same tongue,\\nEither of condemnation or approof;\\nBidding the law make court'sy to their will:\\nHooking both right and wrong to the appetite,\\nTo follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:\\nThough he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,\\nYet hath he in him such a mind of honour.\\nThat, had he twenty heads to tender down\\nOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,\\nBefore his sister should her body stoop\\nTo such abhorr'd pollution.\\nThen, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:\\nMore than our brother is our chastity.\\nI'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,\\nAnd fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSo then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThe miserable have no other medicine\\nBut only hope:\\nI've hope to live, and am prepared to die.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBe absolute for death; either death or life\\nShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:\\nIf I do lose thee, I do lose a thing\\nThat none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,\\nServile to all the skyey influences,\\nThat dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,\\nHourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;\\nFor him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun\\nAnd yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;\\nFor all the accommodations that thou bear'st\\nAre nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;\\nFor thou dost fear the soft and tender fork\\nOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,\\nAnd that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st\\nThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;\\nFor thou exist'st on many a thousand grains\\nThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;\\nFor what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,\\nAnd what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;\\nFor thy complexion shifts to strange effects,\\nAfter the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;\\nFor, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,\\nThou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,\\nAnd death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;\\nFor thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,\\nThe mere effusion of thy proper loins,\\nDo curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,\\nFor ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,\\nBut, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,\\nDreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth\\nBecomes as aged, and doth beg the alms\\nOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,\\nThou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,\\nTo make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this\\nThat bears the name of life? Yet in this life\\nLie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,\\nThat makes these odds all even.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nI humbly thank you.\\nTo sue to live, I find I seek to die;\\nAnd, seeking death, find life: let it come on.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n\\nProvost:\\nWho's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nDear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nMost holy sir, I thank you.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMy business is a word or two with Claudio.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAnd very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nProvost, a word with you.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAs many as you please.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nNow, sister, what's the comfort?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhy,\\nAs all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.\\nLord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,\\nIntends you for his swift ambassador,\\nWhere you shall be an everlasting leiger:\\nTherefore your best appointment make with speed;\\nTo-morrow you set on.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nIs there no remedy?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNone, but such remedy as, to save a head,\\nTo cleave a heart in twain.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nBut is there any?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes, brother, you may live:\\nThere is a devilish mercy in the judge,\\nIf you'll implore it, that will free your life,\\nBut fetter you till death.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nPerpetual durance?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAy, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,\\nThough all the world's vastidity you had,\\nTo a determined scope.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nBut in what nature?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIn such a one as, you consenting to't,\\nWould bark your honour from that trunk you bear,\\nAnd leave you naked.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nLet me know the point.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,\\nLest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,\\nAnd six or seven winters more respect\\nThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?\\nThe sense of death is most in apprehension;\\nAnd the poor beetle, that we tread upon,\\nIn corporal sufferance finds a pang as great\\nAs when a giant dies.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nWhy give you me this shame?\\nThink you I can a resolution fetch\\nFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,\\nI will encounter darkness as a bride,\\nAnd hug it in mine arms.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThere spake my brother; there my father's grave\\nDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:\\nThou art too noble to conserve a life\\nIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,\\nWhose settled visage and deliberate word\\nNips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew\\nAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil\\nHis filth within being cast, he would appear\\nA pond as deep as hell.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThe prenzie Angelo!\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,\\nThe damned'st body to invest and cover\\nIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?\\nIf I would yield him my virginity,\\nThou mightst be freed.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nO heavens! it cannot be.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nYes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,\\nSo to offend him still. This night's the time\\nThat I should do what I abhor to name,\\nOr else thou diest to-morrow.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThou shalt not do't.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, were it but my life,\\nI'ld throw it down for your deliverance\\nAs frankly as a pin.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nThanks, dear Isabel.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nYes. Has he affections in him,\\nThat thus can make him bite the law by the nose,\\nWhen he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,\\nOr of the deadly seven, it is the least.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhich is the least?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nIf it were damnable, he being so wise,\\nWhy would he for the momentary trick\\nBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhat says my brother?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nDeath is a fearful thing.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd shamed life a hateful.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nAy, but to die, and go we know not where;\\nTo lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\\nThis sensible warm motion to become\\nA kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\\nTo bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\\nIn thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;\\nTo be imprison'd in the viewless winds,\\nAnd blown with restless violence round about\\nThe pendent world; or to be worse than worst\\nOf those that lawless and incertain thought\\nImagine howling: 'tis too horrible!\\nThe weariest and most loathed worldly life\\nThat age, ache, penury and imprisonment\\nCan lay on nature is a paradise\\nTo what we fear of death.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAlas, alas!\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nSweet sister, let me live:\\nWhat sin you do to save a brother's life,\\nNature dispenses with the deed so far\\nThat it becomes a virtue.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO you beast!\\nO faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!\\nWilt thou be made a man out of my vice?\\nIs't not a kind of incest, to take life\\nFrom thine own sister's shame? What should I think?\\nHeaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!\\nFor such a warped slip of wilderness\\nNe'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!\\nDie, perish! Might but my bending down\\nReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:\\nI'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,\\nNo word to save thee.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nNay, hear me, Isabel.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, fie, fie, fie!\\nThy sin's not accidental, but a trade.\\nMercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:\\n'Tis best thou diest quickly.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nO hear me, Isabella!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nVouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhat is your will?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMight you dispense with your leisure, I would by and\\nby have some speech with you: the satisfaction I\\nwould require is likewise your own benefit.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be\\nstolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSon, I have overheard what hath passed between you\\nand your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to\\ncorrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her\\nvirtue to practise his judgment with the disposition\\nof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,\\nhath made him that gracious denial which he is most\\nglad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I\\nknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to\\ndeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes\\nthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to\\nyour knees and make ready.\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nLet me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love\\nwith life that I will sue to be rid of it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHold you there: farewell.\\nProvost, a word with you!\\n\\nProvost:\\nWhat's your will, father\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me\\nawhile with the maid: my mind promises with my\\nhabit no loss shall touch her by my company.\\n\\nProvost:\\nIn good time.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:\\nthe goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty\\nbrief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of\\nyour complexion, shall keep the body of it ever\\nfair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,\\nfortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but\\nthat frailty hath examples for his falling, I should\\nwonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this\\nsubstitute, and to save your brother?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am now going to resolve him: I had rather my\\nbrother die by the law than my son should be\\nunlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke\\ndeceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can\\nspeak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or\\ndiscover his government.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter\\nnow stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made\\ntrial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my\\nadvisings: to the love I have in doing good a\\nremedy presents itself. I do make myself believe\\nthat you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged\\nlady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from\\nthe angry law; do no stain to your own gracious\\nperson; and much please the absent duke, if\\nperadventure he shall ever return to have hearing of\\nthis business.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nLet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do\\nanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nVirtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have\\nyou not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of\\nFrederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nShe should this Angelo have married; was affianced\\nto her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between\\nwhich time of the contract and limit of the\\nsolemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,\\nhaving in that perished vessel the dowry of his\\nsister. But mark how heavily this befell to the\\npoor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and\\nrenowned brother, in his love toward her ever most\\nkind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of\\nher fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her\\ncombinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nCan this be so? did Angelo so leave her?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLeft her in her tears, and dried not one of them\\nwith his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,\\npretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,\\nbestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet\\nwears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,\\nis washed with them, but relents not.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maid\\nfrom the world! What corruption in this life, that\\nit will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the\\ncure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps\\nyou from dishonour in doing it.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nShow me how, good father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance\\nof her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that\\nin all reason should have quenched her love, hath,\\nlike an impediment in the current, made it more\\nviolent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his\\nrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree with\\nhis demands to the point; only refer yourself to\\nthis advantage, first, that your stay with him may\\nnot be long; that the time may have all shadow and\\nsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.\\nThis being granted in course,--and now follows\\nall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up\\nyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounter\\nacknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to\\nher recompense: and here, by this, is your brother\\nsaved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana\\nadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid\\nwill I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you\\nthink well to carry this as you may, the doubleness\\nof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.\\nWhat think you of it?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThe image of it gives me content already; and I\\ntrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily\\nto Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his\\nbed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will\\npresently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated\\ngrange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that\\nplace call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that\\nit may be quickly.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nNay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will\\nneeds buy and sell men and women like beasts, we\\nshall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO heavens! what stuff is here\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\n'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the\\nmerriest was put down, and the worser allowed by\\norder of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and\\nfurred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that\\ncraft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAnd you, good brother father. What offence hath\\nthis man made you, sir?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nMarry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we\\ntake him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found\\nupon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have\\nsent to the deputy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nFie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!\\nThe evil that thou causest to be done,\\nThat is thy means to live. Do thou but think\\nWhat 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back\\nFrom such a filthy vice: say to thyself,\\nFrom their abominable and beastly touches\\nI drink, I eat, array myself, and live.\\nCanst thou believe thy living is a life,\\nSo stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIndeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,\\nsir, I would prove--\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,\\nThou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:\\nCorrection and instruction must both work\\nEre this rude beast will profit.\\n\\nELBOW:\\nHe must before the deputy, sir; he has given him\\nwarning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if\\nhe be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were\\nas good go a mile on his errand.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat we were all, as some would seem to be,\\nFrom our faults, as faults from seeming, free!\\n\\nELBOW:\\nHis neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a\\nfriend of mine.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHow now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of\\nCaesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there\\nnone of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be\\nhad now, for putting the hand in the pocket and\\nextracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What\\nsayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't\\nnot drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest\\nthou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is\\nthe way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The\\ntrick of it?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nStill thus, and thus; still worse!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHow doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she\\nstill, ha?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nTroth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she\\nis herself in the tub.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be\\nso: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:\\nan unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going\\nto prison, Pompey?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYes, faith, sir.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I\\nsent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nFor being a bawd, for being a bawd.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWell, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the\\ndue of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he\\ndoubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.\\nFarewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,\\nPompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you\\nwill keep the house.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNo, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.\\nI will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If\\nyou take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the\\nmore. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAnd you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nDoes Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome your ways, sir; come.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYou will not bail me, then, sir?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThen, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?\\nwhat news?\\n\\nELBOW:\\nCome your ways, sir; come.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nGo to kennel, Pompey; go.\\nWhat news, friar, of the duke?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI know none. Can you tell me of any?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSome say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other\\nsome, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nIt was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from\\nthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never born\\nto. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he\\nputs transgression to 't.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe does well in 't.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in\\nhim: something too crabbed that way, friar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nYes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;\\nit is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp\\nit quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put\\ndown. They say this Angelo was not made by man and\\nwoman after this downright way of creation: is it\\ntrue, think you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHow should he be made, then?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSome report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he\\nwas begot between two stock-fishes. But it is\\ncertain that when he makes water his urine is\\ncongealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a\\nmotion generative; that's infallible.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the\\nrebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a\\nman! Would the duke that is absent have done this?\\nEre he would have hanged a man for the getting a\\nhundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing\\na thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he\\nknew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI never heard the absent duke much detected for\\nwomen; he was not inclined that way.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO, sir, you are deceived.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis not possible.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWho, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and\\nhis use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the\\nduke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;\\nthat let me inform you.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou do him wrong, surely.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the\\nduke: and I believe I know the cause of his\\nwithdrawing.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat, I prithee, might be the cause?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNo, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the\\nteeth and the lips: but this I can let you\\nunderstand, the greater file of the subject held the\\nduke to be wise.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWise! why, no question but he was.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nA very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nEither this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:\\nthe very stream of his life and the business he hath\\nhelmed must upon a warranted need give him a better\\nproclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own\\nbringings-forth, and he shall appear to the\\nenvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.\\nTherefore you speak unskilfully: or if your\\nknowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSir, I know him, and I love him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLove talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with\\ndearer love.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nCome, sir, I know what I know.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI can hardly believe that, since you know not what\\nyou speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our\\nprayers are he may, let me desire you to make your\\nanswer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,\\nyou have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call\\nupon you; and, I pray you, your name?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nSir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe shall know you better, sir, if I may live to\\nreport you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI fear you not.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, you hope the duke will return no more; or you\\nimagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I\\ncan do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,\\nfriar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if\\nClaudio die to-morrow or no?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhy should he die, sir?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWhy? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would\\nthe duke we talk of were returned again: the\\nungenitured agent will unpeople the province with\\ncontinency; sparrows must not build in his\\nhouse-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke\\nyet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would\\nnever bring them to light: would he were returned!\\nMarry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.\\nFarewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The\\nduke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on\\nFridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,\\nhe would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown\\nbread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo might nor greatness in mortality\\nCan censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny\\nThe whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong\\nCan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?\\nBut who comes here?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nGo; away with her to prison!\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nGood my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted\\na merciful man; good my lord.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nDouble and treble admonition, and still forfeit in\\nthe same kind! This would make mercy swear and play\\nthe tyrant.\\n\\nProvost:\\nA bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please\\nyour honour.\\n\\nMISTRESS OVERDONE:\\nMy lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.\\nMistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the\\nduke's time; he promised her marriage: his child\\nis a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:\\nI have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThat fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be\\ncalled before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;\\nno more words.\\nProvost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;\\nClaudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished\\nwith divines, and have all charitable preparation.\\nif my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be\\nso with him.\\n\\nProvost:\\nSo please you, this friar hath been with him, and\\nadvised him for the entertainment of death.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nGood even, good father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBliss and goodness on you!\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nOf whence are you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot of this country, though my chance is now\\nTo use it for my time: I am a brother\\nOf gracious order, late come from the See\\nIn special business from his holiness.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhat news abroad i' the world?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNone, but that there is so great a fever on\\ngoodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:\\nnovelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous\\nto be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous\\nto be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce\\ntruth enough alive to make societies secure; but\\nsecurity enough to make fellowships accurst: much\\nupon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This\\nnews is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I\\npray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nOne that, above all other strifes, contended\\nespecially to know himself.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat pleasure was he given to?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nRather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at\\nany thing which professed to make him rejoice: a\\ngentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to\\nhis events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;\\nand let me desire to know how you find Claudio\\nprepared. I am made to understand that you have\\nlent him visitation.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe professes to have received no sinister measure\\nfrom his judge, but most willingly humbles himself\\nto the determination of justice: yet had he framed\\nto himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many\\ndeceiving promises of life; which I by my good\\nleisure have discredited to him, and now is he\\nresolved to die.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nYou have paid the heavens your function, and the\\nprisoner the very debt of your calling. I have\\nlaboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest\\nshore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I\\nfound so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him\\nhe is indeed Justice.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIf his own life answer the straitness of his\\nproceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he\\nchance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nPeace be with you!\\nHe who the sword of heaven will bear\\nShould be as holy as severe;\\nPattern in himself to know,\\nGrace to stand, and virtue go;\\nMore nor less to others paying\\nThan by self-offences weighing.\\nShame to him whose cruel striking\\nKills for faults of his own liking!\\nTwice treble shame on Angelo,\\nTo weed my vice and let his grow!\\nO, what may man within him hide,\\nThough angel on the outward side!\\nHow may likeness made in crimes,\\nMaking practise on the times,\\nTo draw with idle spiders' strings\\nMost ponderous and substantial things!\\nCraft against vice I must apply:\\nWith Angelo to-night shall lie\\nHis old betrothed but despised;\\nSo disguise shall, by the disguised,\\nPay with falsehood false exacting,\\nAnd perform an old contracting.\\n\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nBreak off thy song, and haste thee quick away:\\nHere comes a man of comfort, whose advice\\nHath often still'd my brawling discontent.\\nI cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish\\nYou had not found me here so musical:\\nLet me excuse me, and believe me so,\\nMy mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm\\nTo make bad good, and good provoke to harm.\\nI pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired\\nfor me here to-day? much upon this time have\\nI promised here to meet.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nYou have not been inquired after:\\nI have sat here all day.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI do constantly believe you. The time is come even\\nnow. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may\\nbe I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nI am always bound to you.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nVery well met, and well come.\\nWhat is the news from this good deputy?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHe hath a garden circummured with brick,\\nWhose western side is with a vineyard back'd;\\nAnd to that vineyard is a planched gate,\\nThat makes his opening with this bigger key:\\nThis other doth command a little door\\nWhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;\\nThere have I made my promise\\nUpon the heavy middle of the night\\nTo call upon him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBut shall you on your knowledge find this way?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:\\nWith whispering and most guilty diligence,\\nIn action all of precept, he did show me\\nThe way twice o'er.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAre there no other tokens\\nBetween you 'greed concerning her observance?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNo, none, but only a repair i' the dark;\\nAnd that I have possess'd him my most stay\\nCan be but brief; for I have made him know\\nI have a servant comes with me along,\\nThat stays upon me, whose persuasion is\\nI come about my brother.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis well borne up.\\nI have not yet made known to Mariana\\nA word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!\\nI pray you, be acquainted with this maid;\\nShe comes to do you good.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI do desire the like.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nDo you persuade yourself that I respect you?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nGood friar, I know you do, and have found it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nTake, then, this your companion by the hand,\\nWho hath a story ready for your ear.\\nI shall attend your leisure: but make haste;\\nThe vaporous night approaches.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nWill't please you walk aside?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO place and greatness! millions of false eyes\\nAre stuck upon thee: volumes of report\\nRun with these false and most contrarious quests\\nUpon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit\\nMake thee the father of their idle dreams\\nAnd rack thee in their fancies.\\nWelcome, how agreed?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nShe'll take the enterprise upon her, father,\\nIf you advise it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is not my consent,\\nBut my entreaty too.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nLittle have you to say\\nWhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,\\n'Remember now my brother.'\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nFear me not.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.\\nHe is your husband on a pre-contract:\\nTo bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,\\nSith that the justice of your title to him\\nDoth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:\\nOur corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.\\n\\nProvost:\\nCome hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nIf the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a\\nmarried man, he's his wife's head, and I can never\\ncut off a woman's head.\\n\\nProvost:\\nCome, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a\\ndirect answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio\\nand Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common\\nexecutioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if\\nyou will take it on you to assist him, it shall\\nredeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have\\nyour full time of imprisonment and your deliverance\\nwith an unpitied whipping, for you have been a\\nnotorious bawd.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;\\nbut yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I\\nwould be glad to receive some instruction from my\\nfellow partner.\\n\\nProvost:\\nWhat, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nDo you call, sir?\\n\\nProvost:\\nSirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in\\nyour execution. If you think it meet, compound with\\nhim by the year, and let him abide here with you; if\\nnot, use him for the present and dismiss him. He\\ncannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nA bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.\\n\\nProvost:\\nGo to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn\\nthe scale.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a\\ngood favour you have, but that you have a hanging\\nlook,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nAy, sir; a mystery\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPainting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and\\nyour whores, sir, being members of my occupation,\\nusing painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:\\nbut what mystery there should be in hanging, if I\\nshould be hanged, I cannot imagine.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nSir, it is a mystery.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nProof?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nEvery true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be\\ntoo little for your thief, your true man thinks it\\nbig enough; if it be too big for your thief, your\\nthief thinks it little enough: so every true man's\\napparel fits your thief.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAre you agreed?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nSir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is\\na more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth\\noftener ask forgiveness.\\n\\nProvost:\\nYou, sirrah, provide your block and your axe\\nto-morrow four o'clock.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nCome on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have\\noccasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find\\nme yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you\\na good turn.\\n\\nProvost:\\nCall hither Barnardine and Claudio:\\nThe one has my pity; not a jot the other,\\nBeing a murderer, though he were my brother.\\nLook, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:\\n'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow\\nThou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?\\n\\nCLAUDIO:\\nAs fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour\\nWhen it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:\\nHe will not wake.\\n\\nProvost:\\nWho can do good on him?\\nWell, go, prepare yourself.\\nBut, hark, what noise?\\nHeaven give your spirits comfort!\\nBy and by.\\nI hope it is some pardon or reprieve\\nFor the most gentle Claudio.\\nWelcome father.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe best and wholesomest spirts of the night\\nEnvelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?\\n\\nProvost:\\nNone, since the curfew rung.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot Isabel?\\n\\nProvost:\\nNo.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThey will, then, ere't be long.\\n\\nProvost:\\nWhat comfort is for Claudio?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThere's some in hope.\\n\\nProvost:\\nIt is a bitter deputy.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot so, not so; his life is parallel'd\\nEven with the stroke and line of his great justice:\\nHe doth with holy abstinence subdue\\nThat in himself which he spurs on his power\\nTo qualify in others: were he meal'd with that\\nWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;\\nBut this being so, he's just.\\nNow are they come.\\nThis is a gentle provost: seldom when\\nThe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.\\nHow now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste\\nThat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.\\n\\nProvost:\\nThere he must stay until the officer\\nArise to let him in: he is call'd up.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHave you no countermand for Claudio yet,\\nBut he must die to-morrow?\\n\\nProvost:\\nNone, sir, none.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAs near the dawning, provost, as it is,\\nYou shall hear more ere morning.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHappily\\nYou something know; yet I believe there comes\\nNo countermand; no such example have we:\\nBesides, upon the very siege of justice\\nLord Angelo hath to the public ear\\nProfess'd the contrary.\\nThis is his lordship's man.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAnd here comes Claudio's pardon.\\n\\nMessenger:\\n\\nProvost:\\nI shall obey him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n\\nProvost:\\nI told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss\\nin mine office, awakens me with this unwonted\\nputting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nPray you, let's hear.\\n\\nProvost:\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the\\nafternoon?\\n\\nProvost:\\nA Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one\\nthat is a prisoner nine years old.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHow came it that the absent duke had not either\\ndelivered him to his liberty or executed him? I\\nhave heard it was ever his manner to do so.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHis friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,\\nindeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord\\nAngelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is now apparent?\\n\\nProvost:\\nMost manifest, and not denied by himself.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHath he born himself penitently in prison? how\\nseems he to be touched?\\n\\nProvost:\\nA man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but\\nas a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless\\nof what's past, present, or to come; insensible of\\nmortality, and desperately mortal.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe wants advice.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHe will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty\\nof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he\\nwould not: drunk many times a day, if not many days\\nentirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if\\nto carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming\\nwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMore of him anon. There is written in your brow,\\nprovost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not\\ntruly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the\\nboldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.\\nClaudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is\\nno greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath\\nsentenced him. To make you understand this in a\\nmanifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;\\nfor the which you are to do me both a present and a\\ndangerous courtesy.\\n\\nProvost:\\nPray, sir, in what?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIn the delaying death.\\n\\nProvost:\\nA lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,\\nand an express command, under penalty, to deliver\\nhis head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case\\nas Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBy the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my\\ninstructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine\\nbe this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.\\n\\nProvost:\\nAngelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.\\nShave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was\\nthe desire of the penitent to be so bared before his\\ndeath: you know the course is common. If any thing\\nfall to you upon this, more than thanks and good\\nfortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead\\nagainst it with my life.\\n\\nProvost:\\nPardon me, good father; it is against my oath.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWere you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?\\n\\nProvost:\\nTo him, and to his substitutes.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou will think you have made no offence, if the duke\\navouch the justice of your dealing?\\n\\nProvost:\\nBut what likelihood is in that?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see\\nyou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor\\npersuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go\\nfurther than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.\\nLook you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the\\nduke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the\\nsignet is not strange to you.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI know them both.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe contents of this is the return of the duke: you\\nshall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you\\nshall find, within these two days he will be here.\\nThis is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this\\nvery day receives letters of strange tenor;\\nperchance of the duke's death; perchance entering\\ninto some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what\\nis writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the\\nshepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these\\nthings should be: all difficulties are but easy\\nwhen they are known. Call your executioner, and off\\nwith Barnardine's head: I will give him a present\\nshrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you\\nare amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.\\nCome away; it is almost clear dawn.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nI am as well acquainted here as I was in our house\\nof profession: one would think it were Mistress\\nOverdone's own house, for here be many of her old\\ncustomers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in\\nfor a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,\\nninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made\\nfive marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not\\nmuch in request, for the old women were all dead.\\nThen is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of\\nMaster Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of\\npeach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a\\nbeggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young\\nMaster Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master\\nStarve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young\\nDrop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master\\nForthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the\\ngreat traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed\\nPots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in\\nour trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nSirrah, bring Barnardine hither.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nMaster Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.\\nMaster Barnardine!\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nWhat, ho, Barnardine!\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nYour friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so\\ngood, sir, to rise and be put to death.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nTell him he must awake, and that quickly too.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nPray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are\\nexecuted, and sleep afterwards.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nGo in to him, and fetch him out.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nHe is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nIs the axe upon the block, sirrah?\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nVery ready, sir.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nHow now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nTruly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your\\nprayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nYou rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not\\nfitted for 't.\\n\\nPOMPEY:\\nO, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,\\nand is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the\\nsounder all the next day.\\n\\nABHORSON:\\nLook you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do\\nwe jest now, think you?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily\\nyou are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort\\nyou and pray with you.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nFriar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,\\nand I will have more time to prepare me, or they\\nshall beat out my brains with billets: I will not\\nconsent to die this day, that's certain.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you\\nLook forward on the journey you shall go.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nI swear I will not die to-day for any man's\\npersuasion.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBut hear you.\\n\\nBARNARDINE:\\nNot a word: if you have any thing to say to me,\\ncome to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nUnfit to live or die: O gravel heart!\\nAfter him, fellows; bring him to the block.\\n\\nProvost:\\nNow, sir, how do you find the prisoner?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nA creature unprepared, unmeet for death;\\nAnd to transport him in the mind he is\\nWere damnable.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHere in the prison, father,\\nThere died this morning of a cruel fever\\nOne Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,\\nA man of Claudio's years; his beard and head\\nJust of his colour. What if we do omit\\nThis reprobate till he were well inclined;\\nAnd satisfy the deputy with the visage\\nOf Ragozine, more like to Claudio?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!\\nDispatch it presently; the hour draws on\\nPrefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,\\nAnd sent according to command; whiles I\\nPersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.\\n\\nProvost:\\nThis shall be done, good father, presently.\\nBut Barnardine must die this afternoon:\\nAnd how shall we continue Claudio,\\nTo save me from the danger that might come\\nIf he were known alive?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nLet this be done.\\nPut them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:\\nEre twice the sun hath made his journal greeting\\nTo the under generation, you shall find\\nYour safety manifested.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI am your free dependant.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nQuick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.\\nNow will I write letters to Angelo,--\\nThe provost, he shall bear them, whose contents\\nShall witness to him I am near at home,\\nAnd that, by great injunctions, I am bound\\nTo enter publicly: him I'll desire\\nTo meet me at the consecrated fount\\nA league below the city; and from thence,\\nBy cold gradation and well-balanced form,\\nWe shall proceed with Angelo.\\n\\nProvost:\\nHere is the head; I'll carry it myself.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nConvenient is it. Make a swift return;\\nFor I would commune with you of such things\\nThat want no ear but yours.\\n\\nProvost:\\nI'll make all speed.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe tongue of Isabel. She's come to know\\nIf yet her brother's pardon be come hither:\\nBut I will keep her ignorant of her good,\\nTo make her heavenly comforts of despair,\\nWhen it is least expected.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nHo, by your leave!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGood morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThe better, given me by so holy a man.\\nHath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nHe hath released him, Isabel, from the world:\\nHis head is off and sent to Angelo.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nNay, but it is not so.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,\\nIn your close patience.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou shall not be admitted to his sight.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nUnhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!\\nInjurious world! most damned Angelo!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;\\nForbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.\\nMark what I say, which you shall find\\nBy every syllable a faithful verity:\\nThe duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;\\nOne of our convent, and his confessor,\\nGives me this instance: already he hath carried\\nNotice to Escalus and Angelo,\\nWho do prepare to meet him at the gates,\\nThere to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom\\nIn that good path that I would wish it go,\\nAnd you shall have your bosom on this wretch,\\nGrace of the duke, revenges to your heart,\\nAnd general honour.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am directed by you.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis letter, then, to Friar Peter give;\\n'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:\\nSay, by this token, I desire his company\\nAt Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours\\nI'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you\\nBefore the duke, and to the head of Angelo\\nAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,\\nI am combined by a sacred vow\\nAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:\\nCommand these fretting waters from your eyes\\nWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,\\nIf I pervert your course. Who's here?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nGood even. Friar, where's the provost?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNot within, sir.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see\\nthine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain\\nto dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for\\nmy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set\\nme to 't. But they say the duke will be here\\nto-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:\\nif the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been\\nat home, he had lived.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your\\nreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nFriar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:\\nhe's a better woodman than thou takest him for.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWell, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNay, tarry; I'll go along with thee\\nI can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou have told me too many of him already, sir, if\\nthey be true; if not true, none were enough.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI was once before him for getting a wench with child.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nDid you such a thing?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nYes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;\\nthey would else have married me to the rotten medlar.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBy my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:\\nif bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of\\nit. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nEvery letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nIn most uneven and distracted manner. His actions\\nshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be\\nnot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and\\nredeliver our authorities there\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI guess not.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before his\\nentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,\\nthey should exhibit their petitions in the street?\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHe shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of\\ncomplaints, and to deliver us from devices\\nhereafter, which shall then have no power to stand\\nagainst us.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWell, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes\\ni' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give\\nnotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet\\nhim.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI shall, sir. Fare you well.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nGood night.\\nThis deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant\\nAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!\\nAnd by an eminent body that enforced\\nThe law against it! But that her tender shame\\nWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,\\nHow might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;\\nFor my authority bears of a credent bulk,\\nThat no particular scandal once can touch\\nBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,\\nSave that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,\\nMight in the times to come have ta'en revenge,\\nBy so receiving a dishonour'd life\\nWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!\\nA lack, when once our grace we have forgot,\\nNothing goes right: we would, and we would not.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThese letters at fit time deliver me\\nThe provost knows our purpose and our plot.\\nThe matter being afoot, keep your instruction,\\nAnd hold you ever to our special drift;\\nThough sometimes you do blench from this to that,\\nAs cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,\\nAnd tell him where I stay: give the like notice\\nTo Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,\\nAnd bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;\\nBut send me Flavius first.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nIt shall be speeded well.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:\\nCome, we will walk. There's other of our friends\\nWill greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nTo speak so indirectly I am loath:\\nI would say the truth; but to accuse him so,\\nThat is your part: yet I am advised to do it;\\nHe says, to veil full purpose.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nBe ruled by him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBesides, he tells me that, if peradventure\\nHe speak against me on the adverse side,\\nI should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic\\nThat's bitter to sweet end.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nI would Friar Peter--\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, peace! the friar is come.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nCome, I have found you out a stand most fit,\\nWhere you may have such vantage on the duke,\\nHe shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;\\nThe generous and gravest citizens\\nHave hent the gates, and very near upon\\nThe duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMy very worthy cousin, fairly met!\\nOur old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nHappy return be to your royal grace!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMany and hearty thankings to you both.\\nWe have made inquiry of you; and we hear\\nSuch goodness of your justice, that our soul\\nCannot but yield you forth to public thanks,\\nForerunning more requital.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nYou make my bonds still greater.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nO, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,\\nTo lock it in the wards of covert bosom,\\nWhen it deserves, with characters of brass,\\nA forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time\\nAnd razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,\\nAnd let the subject see, to make them know\\nThat outward courtesies would fain proclaim\\nFavours that keep within. Come, Escalus,\\nYou must walk by us on our other hand;\\nAnd good supporters are you.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nNow is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nJustice, O royal duke! Vail your regard\\nUpon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!\\nO worthy prince, dishonour not your eye\\nBy throwing it on any other object\\nTill you have heard me in my true complaint\\nAnd given me justice, justice, justice, justice!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nRelate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.\\nHere is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:\\nReveal yourself to him.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO worthy duke,\\nYou bid me seek redemption of the devil:\\nHear me yourself; for that which I must speak\\nMust either punish me, not being believed,\\nOr wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:\\nShe hath been a suitor to me for her brother\\nCut off by course of justice,--\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nBy course of justice!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nMost strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:\\nThat Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?\\nThat Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?\\nThat Angelo is an adulterous thief,\\nAn hypocrite, a virgin-violator;\\nIs it not strange and strange?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNay, it is ten times strange.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIt is not truer he is Angelo\\nThan this is all as true as it is strange:\\nNay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth\\nTo the end of reckoning.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAway with her! Poor soul,\\nShe speaks this in the infirmity of sense.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest\\nThere is another comfort than this world,\\nThat thou neglect me not, with that opinion\\nThat I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible\\nThat which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible\\nBut one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,\\nMay seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute\\nAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,\\nIn all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,\\nBe an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:\\nIf he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,\\nHad I more name for badness.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBy mine honesty,\\nIf she be mad,--as I believe no other,--\\nHer madness hath the oddest frame of sense,\\nSuch a dependency of thing on thing,\\nAs e'er I heard in madness.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO gracious duke,\\nHarp not on that, nor do not banish reason\\nFor inequality; but let your reason serve\\nTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,\\nAnd hide the false seems true.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMany that are not mad\\nHave, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI am the sister of one Claudio,\\nCondemn'd upon the act of fornication\\nTo lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:\\nI, in probation of a sisterhood,\\nWas sent to by my brother; one Lucio\\nAs then the messenger,--\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThat's I, an't like your grace:\\nI came to her from Claudio, and desired her\\nTo try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo\\nFor her poor brother's pardon.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThat's he indeed.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou were not bid to speak.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNo, my good lord;\\nNor wish'd to hold my peace.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI wish you now, then;\\nPray you, take note of it: and when you have\\nA business for yourself, pray heaven you then\\nBe perfect.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nI warrant your honour.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThe warrants for yourself; take heed to't.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nThis gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nRight.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt may be right; but you are i' the wrong\\nTo speak before your time. Proceed.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI went\\nTo this pernicious caitiff deputy,--\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThat's somewhat madly spoken.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nPardon it;\\nThe phrase is to the matter.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMended again. The matter; proceed.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nIn brief, to set the needless process by,\\nHow I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,\\nHow he refell'd me, and how I replied,--\\nFor this was of much length,--the vile conclusion\\nI now begin with grief and shame to utter:\\nHe would not, but by gift of my chaste body\\nTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,\\nRelease my brother; and, after much debatement,\\nMy sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,\\nAnd I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,\\nHis purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant\\nFor my poor brother's head.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis is most likely!\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, that it were as like as it is true!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBy heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,\\nOr else thou art suborn'd against his honour\\nIn hateful practise. First, his integrity\\nStands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason\\nThat with such vehemency he should pursue\\nFaults proper to himself: if he had so offended,\\nHe would have weigh'd thy brother by himself\\nAnd not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:\\nConfess the truth, and say by whose advice\\nThou camest here to complain.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nAnd is this all?\\nThen, O you blessed ministers above,\\nKeep me in patience, and with ripen'd time\\nUnfold the evil which is here wrapt up\\nIn countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,\\nAs I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!\\nTo prison with her! Shall we thus permit\\nA blasting and a scandalous breath to fall\\nOn him so near us? This needs must be a practise.\\nWho knew of Your intent and coming hither?\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nOne that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nA ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;\\nI do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord\\nFor certain words he spake against your grace\\nIn your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWords against me? this is a good friar, belike!\\nAnd to set on this wretched woman here\\nAgainst our substitute! Let this friar be found.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nBut yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,\\nI saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,\\nA very scurvy fellow.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nBlessed be your royal grace!\\nI have stood by, my lord, and I have heard\\nYour royal ear abused. First, hath this woman\\nMost wrongfully accused your substitute,\\nWho is as free from touch or soil with her\\nAs she from one ungot.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWe did believe no less.\\nKnow you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nI know him for a man divine and holy;\\nNot scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,\\nAs he's reported by this gentleman;\\nAnd, on my trust, a man that never yet\\nDid, as he vouches, misreport your grace.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, most villanously; believe it.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nWell, he in time may come to clear himself;\\nBut at this instant he is sick my lord,\\nOf a strange fever. Upon his mere request,\\nBeing come to knowledge that there was complaint\\nIntended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,\\nTo speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know\\nIs true and false; and what he with his oath\\nAnd all probation will make up full clear,\\nWhensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.\\nTo justify this worthy nobleman,\\nSo vulgarly and personally accused,\\nHer shall you hear disproved to her eyes,\\nTill she herself confess it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGood friar, let's hear it.\\nDo you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?\\nO heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!\\nGive us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;\\nIn this I'll be impartial; be you judge\\nOf your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?\\nFirst, let her show her face, and after speak.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nPardon, my lord; I will not show my face\\nUntil my husband bid me.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhat, are you married?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNo, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAre you a maid?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNo, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nA widow, then?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNeither, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are\\nneither maid, widow, nor wife.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSilence that fellow: I would he had some cause\\nTo prattle for himself.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWell, my lord.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nMy lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;\\nAnd I confess besides I am no maid:\\nI have known my husband; yet my husband\\nKnows not that ever he knew me.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nHe was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nFor the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nWell, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThis is no witness for Lord Angelo.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNow I come to't my lord\\nShe that accuses him of fornication,\\nIn self-same manner doth accuse my husband,\\nAnd charges him my lord, with such a time\\nWhen I'll depose I had him in mine arms\\nWith all the effect of love.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nCharges she more than me?\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNot that I know.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNo? you say your husband.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nWhy, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,\\nWho thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,\\nBut knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nThis is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nMy husband bids me; now I will unmask.\\nThis is that face, thou cruel Angelo,\\nWhich once thou sworest was worth the looking on;\\nThis is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,\\nWas fast belock'd in thine; this is the body\\nThat took away the match from Isabel,\\nAnd did supply thee at thy garden-house\\nIn her imagined person.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nKnow you this woman?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nCarnally, she says.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nSirrah, no more!\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nEnough, my lord.\\n\\nANGELO:\\nMy lord, I must confess I know this woman:\\nAnd five years since there was some speech of marriage\\nBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,\\nPartly for that her promised proportions\\nCame short of composition, but in chief\\nFor that her reputation was disvalued\\nIn levity: since which time of five years\\nI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,\\nUpon my faith and honour.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nNoble prince,\\nAs there comes light from heaven and words from breath,\\nAs there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,\\nI am affianced this man's wife as strongly\\nAs words could make up vows: and, my good lord,\\nBut Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house\\nHe knew me as a wife. As this is true,\\nLet me in safety raise me from my knees\\nOr else for ever be confixed here,\\nA marble monument!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI did but smile till now:\\nNow, good my lord, give me the scope of justice\\nMy patience here is touch'd. I do perceive\\nThese poor informal women are no more\\nBut instruments of some more mightier member\\nThat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,\\nTo find this practise out.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nAy, with my heart\\nAnd punish them to your height of pleasure.\\nThou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,\\nCompact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,\\nThough they would swear down each particular saint,\\nWere testimonies against his worth and credit\\nThat's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,\\nSit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains\\nTo find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.\\nThere is another friar that set them on;\\nLet him be sent for.\\n\\nFRIAR PETER:\\nWould he were here, my lord! for he indeed\\nHath set the women on to this complaint:\\nYour provost knows the place where he abides\\nAnd he may fetch him.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGo do it instantly.\\nAnd you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,\\nWhom it concerns to hear this matter forth,\\nDo with your injuries as seems you best,\\nIn any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;\\nBut stir not you till you have well determined\\nUpon these slanderers.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nMy lord, we'll do it throughly.\\nSignior Lucio, did not you say you knew that\\nFriar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing\\nbut in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most\\nvillanous speeches of the duke.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWe shall entreat you to abide here till he come and\\nenforce them against him: we shall find this friar a\\nnotable fellow.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nAs any in Vienna, on my word.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCall that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.\\nPray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you\\nshall see how I'll handle her.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nNot better than he, by her own report.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nSay you?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMarry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,\\nshe would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,\\nshe'll be ashamed.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nI will go darkly to work with her.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThat's the way; for women are light at midnight.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all\\nthat you have said.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMy lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with\\nthe provost.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nIn very good time: speak not you to him till we\\ncall upon you.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nMum.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nCome, sir: did you set these women on to slander\\nLord Angelo? they have confessed you did.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n'Tis false.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nHow! know you where you are?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nRespect to your great place! and let the devil\\nBe sometime honour'd for his burning throne!\\nWhere is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nThe duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:\\nLook you speak justly.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBoldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,\\nCome you to seek the lamb here of the fox?\\nGood night to your redress! Is the duke gone?\\nThen is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,\\nThus to retort your manifest appeal,\\nAnd put your trial in the villain's mouth\\nWhich here you come to accuse.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThis is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nWhy, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,\\nIs't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women\\nTo accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth\\nAnd in the witness of his proper ear,\\nTo call him villain? and then to glance from him\\nTo the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?\\nTake him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you\\nJoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.\\nWhat 'unjust'!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nBe not so hot; the duke\\nDare no more stretch this finger of mine than he\\nDare rack his own: his subject am I not,\\nNor here provincial. My business in this state\\nMade me a looker on here in Vienna,\\nWhere I have seen corruption boil and bubble\\nTill it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,\\nBut faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes\\nStand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,\\nAs much in mock as mark.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nSlander to the state! Away with him to prison!\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?\\nIs this the man that you did tell us of?\\n\\nLUCIO:\\n'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:\\ndo you know me?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nI remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I\\nmet you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nMost notedly, sir.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nDo you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a\\nfool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make\\nthat my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and\\nmuch more, much worse.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nO thou damnable fellow!

Away with\\nhim to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him\\nto prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him\\nspeak no more. Away with those giglots too, and\\nwith the other confederate companion!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nCome, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you\\nbald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must\\nyou? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!\\nshow your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!\\nWill't not off?\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nThou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.\\nFirst, provost, let me bail these gentle three.\\nSneak not away, sir; for the friar and you\\nMust have a word anon. Lay hold on him.\\n\\nLUCIO:\\nThis may prove worse than hanging.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\n\\nANGELO:\\nO my dread lord,\\nI should be guiltier than my guiltiness,\\nTo think I can be undiscernible,\\nWhen I perceive your grace, like power divine,\\nHath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,\\nNo longer session hold upon my shame,\\nBut let my trial be mine own confession:\\nImmediate sentence then and sequent death\\nIs all the grace I beg.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nCome hither, Mariana.\\nSay, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?\\n\\nANGELO:\\nI was, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nGo take her hence, and marry her instantly.\\nDo you the office, friar; which consummate,\\nReturn him here again. Go with him, provost.\\n\\nESCALUS:\\nMy lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour\\nThan at the strangeness of it.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nCome hither, Isabel.\\nYour friar is now your prince: as I was then\\nAdvertising and holy to your business,\\nNot changing heart with habit, I am still\\nAttorney'd at your service.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nO, give me pardon,\\nThat I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd\\nYour unknown sovereignty!\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou are pardon'd, Isabel:\\nAnd now, dear maid, be you as free to us.\\nYour brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;\\nAnd you may marvel why I obscured myself,\\nLabouring to save his life, and would not rather\\nMake rash remonstrance of my hidden power\\nThan let him so be lost. O most kind maid,\\nIt was the swift celerity of his death,\\nWhich I did think with slower foot came on,\\nThat brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!\\nThat life is better life, past fearing death,\\nThan that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,\\nSo happy is your brother.\\n\\nISABELLA:\\nI do, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nFor this new-married man approaching here,\\nWhose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd\\nYour well defended honour, you must pardon\\nFor Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--\\nBeing criminal, in double violation\\nOf sacred chastity and of promise-breach\\nThereon dependent, for your brother's life,--\\nThe very mercy of the law cries out\\nMost audible, even from his proper tongue,\\n'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'\\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;\\nLike doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.\\nThen, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;\\nWhich, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.\\nWe do condemn thee to the very block\\nWhere Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.\\nAway with him!\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nO my most gracious lord,\\nI hope you will not mock me with a husband.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nIt is your husband mock'd you with a husband.\\nConsenting to the safeguard of your honour,\\nI thought your marriage fit; else imputation,\\nFor that he knew you, might reproach your life\\nAnd choke your good to come; for his possessions,\\nAlthough by confiscation they are ours,\\nWe do instate and widow you withal,\\nTo buy you a better husband.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nO my dear lord,\\nI crave no other, nor no better man.\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nNever crave him; we are definitive.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nGentle my liege,--\\n\\nDUKE VINCENTIO:\\nYou do but lose your labour.\\nAway with him to death!\\nNow, sir, to you.\\n\\nMARIANA:\\nO my good lord!

How likes Hortensio that?\\n\\nHORTENSIO:\\nMy widow says, thus she conceives her tale.\\n\\nPETRUCHIO:\\nVery well mended.

Come on, and kiss me, Kate.\\n\\nLUCENTIO:\\nWell, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.\\n\\nVINCENTIO:\\n'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.\\n\\nLUCENTIO:\\nBut a harsh hearing when women are froward.\\n\\nPETRUCHIO:\\nCome, Kate, we'll to bed.\\nWe three are married, but you two are sped.\\n'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;\\nAnd, being a winner, God give you good night!\\n\\nHORTENSIO:\\nNow, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.\\n\\nLUCENTIO:\\n'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.\\n\\nMaster:\\nBoatswain!\\n\\nBoatswain:\\nHere, master: what cheer?\\n\\nMaster:\\nGood, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,\\nor we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.\\n\\nBoatswain:\\nHeigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!\\nyare, yare!

Please you, farther.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nMy brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--\\nI pray thee, mark me--that a brother should\\nBe so perfidious!--he whom next thyself\\nOf all the world I loved and to him put\\nThe manage of my state; as at that time\\nThrough all the signories it was the first\\nAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\\nIn dignity, and for the liberal arts\\nWithout a parallel; those being all my study,\\nThe government I cast upon my brother\\nAnd to my state grew stranger, being transported\\nAnd rapt in secret studies.

He being thus lorded,\\nNot only with what my revenue yielded,\\nBut what my power might else exact, like one\\nWho having into truth, by telling of it,\\nMade such a sinner of his memory,\\nTo credit his own lie, he did believe\\nHe was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution\\nAnd executing the outward face of royalty,\\nWith all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--\\nDost thou hear?\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nYour tale, sir, would cure deafness.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nTo have no screen between this part he play'd\\nAnd him he play'd it for, he needs will be\\nAbsolute Milan.

Dear, they durst not,\\nSo dear the love my people bore me, nor set\\nA mark so bloody on the business, but\\nWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.\\nIn few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\\nBore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared\\nA rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,\\nNor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\\nInstinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,\\nTo cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh\\nTo the winds whose pity, sighing back again,\\nDid us but loving wrong.\\n\\nMIRANDA:\\nAlack, what trouble\\nWas I then to you!\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nO, a cherubim\\nThou wast that did preserve me.

Where was she born? speak; tell me.\\n\\nARIEL:\\nSir, in Argier.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nO, was she so? I must\\nOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,\\nWhich thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,\\nFor mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible\\nTo enter human hearing, from Argier,\\nThou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did\\nThey would not take her life. Is not this true?\\n\\nARIEL:\\nAy, sir.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nThis blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child\\nAnd here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,\\nAs thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;\\nAnd, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\\nTo act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,\\nRefusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\\nBy help of her more potent ministers\\nAnd in her most unmitigable rage,\\nInto a cloven pine; within which rift\\nImprison'd thou didst painfully remain\\nA dozen years; within which space she died\\nAnd left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans\\nAs fast as mill-wheels strike.

Believe me, sir,\\nIt carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.\\n\\nPROSPERO:\\nNo, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses\\nAs we have, such.

O thou mine heir\\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\\nHath made his meal on thee?\\n\\nFRANCISCO:\\nSir, he may live:\\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\\nAnd ride upon their backs; he trod the water,\\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\\nThe surge most swoln that met him; his bold head\\n'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd\\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\\nTo the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,\\nAs stooping to relieve him: I not doubt\\nHe came alive to land.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nNo, no, he's gone.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\\nBut rather lose her to an African;\\nWhere she at least is banish'd from your eye,\\nWho hath cause to wet the grief on't.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nPrithee, peace.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nYou were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise\\nBy all of us, and the fair soul herself\\nWeigh'd between loathness and obedience, at\\nWhich end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your\\nson,\\nI fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\\nMore widows in them of this business' making\\nThan we bring men to comfort them:\\nThe fault's your own.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nSo is the dear'st o' the loss.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nMy lord Sebastian,\\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness\\nAnd time to speak it in: you rub the sore,\\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nVery well.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nAnd most chirurgeonly.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,\\nWhen you are cloudy.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nFoul weather?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nVery foul.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nHad I plantation of this isle, my lord,--\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nHe'ld sow't with nettle-seed.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nOr docks, or mallows.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nAnd were the king on't, what would I do?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\n'Scape being drunk for want of wine.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nI' the commonwealth I would by contraries\\nExecute all things; for no kind of traffic\\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,\\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\\nNo occupation; all men idle, all;\\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\\nNo sovereignty;--\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nYet he would be king on't.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nThe latter end of his commonwealth forgets the\\nbeginning.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nAll things in common nature should produce\\nWithout sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,\\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth,\\nOf its own kind, all foison, all abundance,\\nTo feed my innocent people.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nNo marrying 'mong his subjects?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNone, man; all idle: whores and knaves.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nI would with such perfection govern, sir,\\nTo excel the golden age.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nGod save his majesty!\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nLong live Gonzalo!\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nAnd,--do you mark me, sir?\\n\\nALONSO:\\nPrithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nI do well believe your highness; and\\ndid it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,\\nwho are of such sensible and nimble lungs that\\nthey always use to laugh at nothing.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\n'Twas you we laughed at.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nWho in this kind of merry fooling am nothing\\nto you: so you may continue and laugh at\\nnothing still.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nWhat a blow was there given!\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nAn it had not fallen flat-long.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nYou are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift\\nthe moon out of her sphere, if she would continue\\nin it five weeks without changing.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWe would so, and then go a bat-fowling.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNay, good my lord, be not angry.\\n\\nGONZALO:\\nNo, I warrant you; I will not adventure\\nmy discretion so weakly. Will you laugh\\nme asleep, for I am very heavy?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nGo sleep, and hear us.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nWhat, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\\nWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find\\nThey are inclined to do so.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nPlease you, sir,\\nDo not omit the heavy offer of it:\\nIt seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\\nIt is a comforter.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nWe two, my lord,\\nWill guard your person while you take your rest,\\nAnd watch your safety.\\n\\nALONSO:\\nThank you. Wondrous heavy.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nIt is the quality o' the climate.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWhy\\nDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\\nMyself disposed to sleep.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNor I; my spirits are nimble.\\nThey fell together all, as by consent;\\nThey dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,\\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--\\nAnd yet me thinks I see it in thy face,\\nWhat thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and\\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\\nDropping upon thy head.\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nWhat, art thou waking?\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nDo you not hear me speak?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN:\\nI do; and surely\\nIt is a sleepy language and thou speak'st\\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\\nWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,\\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\\n\\nANTONIO:\\nNoble Sebastian,\\nThou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st\\nWhiles thou art waking.\\n\""

As a suggestion, consider expanding your model to around 15 million parameters, as smaller models in the range of 10M to 20M tend to comprehend English better. Once your LLM becomes proficient in language, you can fine-tune it for specific use cases.\n",
